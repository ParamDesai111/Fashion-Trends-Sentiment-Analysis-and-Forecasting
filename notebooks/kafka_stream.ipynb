It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

Because I’m buying them years after they first appeared, fewer people are wearing them (and I’m getting a nice discount). And because they have unexpected design elements, it’s difficult to place them in any era….so they are timeless in their own way.

It can take FOREVER for clothes to sell if you\\'re not making an active effort. By the time your stuff sells, you were probably looking to donate it anyway.

Only selling when you want to get rid of something is time consuming and usually gets you less money. \\n\\n3. Having the stock photos and information catalogued makes it easier to sell than a few years later when you\\'re struggling to find the original listing and specs online. Right or wrong, stock photos and website info really increases the value of used clothes. \\n\\n4. The listings themselves are a good way to keep track of what you have in your closet. \\n\\n5.

Something might sell before you want to get rid of it. At that point you either need to cancel the order or part with something prematurely. \\n\\n2. It has the psychological impact of making clothes feel disposable and creates a norm in which people cycle through clothes incredibly quickly and overconsume under the guise of \"eh I can just sell it\". In a way it\\'s good that it\\'s so f\\\\*cking hard to sell used clothes, because it makes you think twice and thrice about whether you want to click \"buy\". \\n\\n3. For those struggling to control a budding shopping addiction, selling and thus spending time on selling apps can aggravate the problem. \\n\\n4.

Confidence is a pretty big part of wearing bold stuff and being comfortable in your own skin makes a huge difference. It also takes a degree of emotional energy to handle the extra attention. No, no one\\'s going to assail, spit on you, and call you a harlot causing a need for you to steel yourself before stepping out of the house. There are just days you don\\'t feel like being *that person* and being uncomfortable with it shows. \\n\\nAnother idea of something \"wearing you\" is that the item is too much or doesn\\'t fit the wearer in the context of the vibe or intention. So if your hair, your makeup, the rest of your outfit says 2010s beige minimalism, high shine PVC spiked goth club platform boots are probably going to be incongruous in a way that stands out negatively.\\nMaking something look cohesive or intentional will serve to make bold items look more natural. | Depending on how balls to the wall you wanna go, it\\'s picking what\\'s going to be the highlight and styling the outfit around it.\\n\\nHaving bridging colours so things feel intentional - like if you want to go for an all red outfit, it\\'s generally smarter and less eye watering to do 1-2 items be a true red, and the rest of the outfit be red adjacent - so burgundies or pinks,  depending on the colour palette you\\'re working with.\\n\\nAnother thing is you have to nail the style and fit before you dial up the colour or prints.   Stuff has to fit right and sit on you nicely before YOU wear the outfit.  If it\\'s ill fitting - too big or too small or badly tailored, the outfit is going to wear you.\\n\\nAnd also it has to be something you LOVE.

Both your body and the garments. Understanding if you have long/short/balanced torso and legs can be a helpful starting point. Then look at the proportions of the garment: some oversized tshirts emphasize the arm width and length, others are cut to have more length in the body or width. Depending on what you’re pairing it with it will change the visual “weight” of the outfit and emphasize different features. Some people use the rule of “big top, little bottoms” or “little top, big bottoms” to achieve balance but it doesn’t always work well (for me). Tucking, rolling sleeves, material composition and drape, and undergarments also make a big difference. (Sorry not a straightforward answer 😅) | This answer is not super helpful but I think it depends a lot on context. When I go to hip hop class and everyone is wearing baggy-on-baggy streetwear, I feel so natural wearing all baggy too and I feel really wrong and self-conscious wearing something tight fitting. Vs if I go to another thing where everyone is wearing leggings or mini skirts, and I wear baggy cargo pants and hoodie, I look silly and like I didn’t make an effort. | Like already stated knowing what works on your proportions are the first part- I’m 5’2” with a short waist, no boobs, and a very straight build (like a brick, lol), and I love love love oversized. Just can’t be wearing the same stuff as a willowy 5’8” person. \\n\\nBut also fabric choice is huge. Many button downs are too stiff and look like a sloppy trapeze if they are worn oversize ( but again, probably fine on tall and thin), whereas a finer fabric with more drape would work better. Same for pants too, fabric with more movement that hangs better can look great. When I’m wearing big knits, I always make sure my pants are more drapey or stick with flares to kinda balance out the oversize top so I don’t look like Im trying to walk on tiny toothpick legs \\n\\nPlus, accessories are always helpful'}\n",

I then make as many different outfits as I can with that item. When I feel like I can’t come up with anything else, I move on to another item and repeat. If an item hardly goes with anything else in my closet, I may consider donating it. \\n\\n- Using the random outfit generator, I play around till something sparks an idea. Rarely will the generator come up with a whole outfit that works, but seeing, for example, this skirt with that jacket that I never thought about pairing will get me started. \\n\\n- I go through a category of clothing and arrange items according to how long it’s been since I’ve worn them. Like my long-sleeved dresses now have the recently worn items at the bottom so I see the stuff that’s been collecting dust at the top of the page and am more tempted to wear those items. \\n\\n- I go through entire categories after a season has passed and see what I never got around to wearing. I’ll consider if there was a valid reason (formal dress with no formal events that season will get a pass; one sundress unworn when I wore other sundresses repeatedly, no pass) and donate items I clearly made no effort to wear. \\n\\n- When shopping, I open the app and see what all I can match up with an item I’m considering buying. Helps me avoid purchases I’ll never wear. \\n\\n- I look through my most worn items for themes. I tend to get the most use out of purses, jackets, and boots in bright colors. This guides me when I’m considering spending a little more on something that fits one of those categories.\\n\\n- I look through my cost per wear list and assess where my mistakes are happening. Some items are worth extra money and some rarely are. This often coincides with most/least worn items but not always. A super cheap item is still a bit useless if I only use it once, and an expensive item that I won’t use often is also better to avoid. \\n\\n- There’s a notes section on each item & I use it to type in words like “thrifted” or “new” so I can search those terms and see if I’m maintaining my preference for a mostly thrifted wardrobe. I also type in the purchase date of an item so I have some frame of reference if an item is on my rarely worn list. Seeing you’ve owned something for 5 years and worn it once hits different than misremembering you bought it 2 years ago. | I’ve been wondering this myself as well! I use Stylebook and I mostly use it for knowing what items I wear most, when the last time I wore something was, but honestly the packing feature is my absolute favorite.\\n\\nIt’s also very enlightening to see what gets worn the least, and I now know to cull these items for my ongoing purge. It’s hard to argue with worn history facts!\\n\\nWhat I do not inventory & track:\\n- Earrings\\n- Activewear (including workout-only shoes)\\n- Pajamas / at home only loungewear\\n- Socks, bras, underwear, hosiery\\n- Gloves, hats and other seasonal accessories I rarely wear\\n- Swimwear\\n\\nI go back and forth on whether it’d be helpful to start inventorying/tracking activewear, though. I have so much, and work out often enough that I’d get something out of it, but I don’t want to burden my daily life by having to log everything. Definitely curious to hear what others are doing! | I've been using cataloguing my wardrobe as motivation to also do the wardrobe purge/reorganization I've been meaning to do for like a year. I just completely emptied out my entire dresser and I've logged almost all of it, even the stuff that I hardly ever wear. For the things that I was already kind of on the fence about, if I couldn't even bring myself to take a picture of them, that was a pretty clear final sign that I could let it go. My drawers are already SO MUCH ROOMIER y'all. \\n\\nBut I only started about a month ago; have a feeling that, after a year or so, I'll have a much easier time letting go of those edge cases that I kept but already kinda know I shouldn't have. And I'm also hoping it will help me discover new possibilities for older pieces that I haven't been wearing but still feel like I need—who knows? Maybe they'll be my new-old staples.\\n\\nIt also helps that I'm really good at remembering facts about my clothing. I remember where and when I bought things and approximately how much I paid back through about 2018 or so—couldn't tell you why, but it's useful. Maybe because that's when I started selling seriously on Poshmark, which completely upended my relationship with shopping? That Poshmark experience also helps in that I'm really comfy with photographing/editing clothing AND/OR quickly finding stock photos for stuff I know that I own. I've definitely used stock photos for things I've bought recently because I knew I could find them through my email receipts or Shop app aaaand that's easier than dragging the thing out and actually taking a decent picture.

On the other extreme (but much rarer) you have people who only buy thrifted clothes once every ten years and don\\'t care about fashion. \\n\\nI quit fast fashion, including Zara and H&M, about three years ago, and I was thinking about what more realistic action might look like for a person with an urban job that requires them to be put together, besides give up new clothes entirely. What can a person do who still wants to buy new clothes but wants to do so more responsibly. The thing I came up with was the commitment to wear everything I buy at least 100 times. I know some people have done a \"30 wears\" challenge, but that just doesn\\'t seem like enough to me. What about when you buy something, you have to have an idea that it will be possible to wear it at least 100 times before it goes out of style, wears out, you get sick of it, etc. In most instances this will mean it has to be in your wardrobe for at least a few years and get pretty regular wear.\\n\\nI\\'m certainly not the first person to come up with this, but I was thinking about how it would change one\\'s dressing and shopping habits.

We so often think that we need more than we do. I got a new sweater recently, and after it was a success after a few wears, I immediately started thinking along the lines of  \"hey I should really get at least one more of these,\" because if one is good, two or three is better, right? But then I started thinking about the 100 wears idea, and realized it would be a lot harder to wear that sweater 100 times if there were one or two more of them, even in different colors. I\\'m not saying it\\'s always a bad idea to have multiples of something, but questioning the assumption seemed important. If I wear it twice a week for half the year, that\\'s still just about 50 wears.  I might realistically wear it 25 times the second year, and maybe even less frequently the third year. \\n\\nIt\\'s something I\\'ve decided to start tracking, and to consider when I make my purchases. Since I quite fast fashion, I buy fewer, better clothes, and I\\'ve never been happier with my wardrobe. But I realized recently that I also need to get rid of that fast fashion mindset that more is always better. \\n\\nAnyone else interested in the 100 wears idea?', 'images_processed': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hava5s/wearing_every_piece_100_times/', 'section': 'hot', 'created_utc': 1733810766.0, 'top_comments': \"I have been tracking everything I wear for five and a half years, since July 2019, and you are SO right that we tend to overestimate how much we wear stuff! When I started, I guessed how many times I had worn stuff before I started tracking but after tracking for a while, I cut all those guesses WAY down in my spreadsheet. Even my favourite blouse, which I had thought of myself as wearing on repeat, I wore only 4 or 5 times in the first six months. But now most of my clothes have been bought since then and have completely accurate tracking. On my tracker, I have columns that go green at 30 wears, 50 wears and 100 wears. I also track cost per wear - I absolutely LOVE it when it's less than £1 per wear!\\n\\n\\nSince I started tracking, I have been cutting my wardrobe down by honestly more than 90% - I had about 2000 things when I started. I'm aiming for 88 items in my capsule wardrobe, including everything except pyjamas, underwear and jewellery (I have very few pieces). I'm very close! Also nothing helped me discover my personal style than tracking my wears. It shows you so clearly what you love to wear, in black and white data. \\n\\n\\n100 wears is a really good goal but it just won't be possible for lots of stuff - it will just fall apart by then, it's sad to say. But wearing it until it's worn out is an achievement in itself! I consider it worthwhile after 30 wears and/or £1 (or $1 or €1) per wear. It can take a LONG time to hit either of those goals, even with relatively cheap things, and it's really helping me change my shopping habits.\\n\\n\\nAfter a few years of really cutting back on clothes shopping, I bought too much this year, and I'm trying to be brave enough to do a complete clothes no buy next year. My other wardrobe goal for 2025 is to wear EVERYTHING I own at least 10 times. It's a tough but achievable goal for almost everything, with the exception of a couple of specialised items. I will reassess everything I own that doesn't get worn that much at the end of the year. It's a quantifiable commitment to loving and using what I own! | While I haven’t intentionally thought I need to wear my items 100 times each, I do track my wardrobe through Stylebook and see I’ve long surpassed that with many items.

The black dress worn 61 days is from a Target brand, but I purchased it at Goodwill, meaning its true number of wears is likely higher. It’s also still in excellent condition. My fit & flare puffer coat worn 45 days still looks new; it was a splurge (for me, a poor person) from Venus after I waited for a sale and coupon code to align. \\n\\nLike anyone, I do have items in my closet I’ve worn only once (my least worn tab in Stylebook shames me), but I try and learn a lesson from each of those purchases. Am I buying impractical items? Fancy open-toe shoes, for instance, do they really fit into my life when I need closed shoes for work and only get to wear open-toe heels for nights out during the few months of warm weather where I live? Do I really need multiple colors of this type of shoe, when just a pair in silver would cover the majority of my going out summer looks? Admittedly, I own open-toe heels in many colors, a lot of them purchased when I worked a different job, but these questions can stop me from continuing to acquire more.\\n\\nIf I need a formal dress I don’t expect to wear more than a few times, I get it from a thrift shop, take care of it, and donate it back when I’m done with it. Short sequined or metallic dresses actually get a decent amount of use in my closet, so I’m more flexible with buying those. I’ve acquired a few recently that I still haven’t worn, so I’ve stopped buying more and am looking for opportunities to wear the ones I already own in pink, red, green, gold, and rainbow. Not even a party in the club every night kind of gal needs more colors than that. (Totally revealing my age with the thought that women still wear sequined dresses to a club, ha.) I wear them to parties, festive theatre events, and sometimes even casually with the right styling. \\n\\nMy goal is to get my cost per wear down to $1 or less on everything. Some items are easy due to their low starting cost, but it helps justify the larger purchases when it’s something I really need, like orthotic sandals or a winter coat. My current [lowest cost per wear list](https://imgur.com/a/oThKNEh) shows decent overlap with my most worn items but also reveals some items that just started off unbelievably cheap to begin with, like a silk turtleneck sweater I found at the Goodwill outlet where you pay by the pound. \\n\\nAll this said, no matter my goals of wearing items many times and driving down their cost per wear, if I discover I really don’t like something after I bought it and do not see myself forcing its use (usually an ill-fitting or horribly uncomfortable item), I donate right away. I’m big on not keeping a lot of clutter around and want someone else to be able to enjoy the item while it’s still practically new and in fashion. | Love this idea! I’ve been sort of trying to do this to justify my more expensive purchases as I ween off of fast fashion by utilizing a rough “Cost Per Wear”. I had a hard time justifying these expensive jeans but they’re such good quality and look amazing and I’ve worn them probably over one hundred times, thus bringing the cost per wear down to 1$ roughly. Meanwhile there are bodysuits in my closet that Im ashamed to admit I’ve never worn that have a 20$ CPW.\"}\n",

One notable exception is Banana Republic that has gone for route A). \\n\\nThere is one \"loophole\", kind of, of up-and-coming brands who are in that early high-growth phase of trying to gain customers at all costs before they start worrying too much about profitability. But this is a phase rather than a category, and as soon as they get popular enough they\\'re going to have to make the same tough decisions. \\n\\nMy question is how are you adjusting to this reality? Are you buying less, or accepting lower quality? I\\'m trying to buy better and buy less, but honestly \"buying better\" costs a LOT more than I was ready for. Instead of paying $80 for a sweater that is equivalent to the quality of a $50 sweater ten years ago, it\\'s more like $250. I\\'ve had to make some tough decisions about not buying the trendy thing I wanted simply because I can\\'t afford to drop that kind of money on something that might be outdated in a couple of years. I feel like my wardrobe has gotten more boring as a result, but maybe that\\'s a good thing - fashion cycles now are too fast for anyone to keep up with, including the environment.', 'images_processed': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1h4z8bn/we_are_never_going_to_see_that_goodquality_yet/', 'section': 'hot', 'created_utc': 1733157634.0, 'top_comments': 'Honestly I\\'m rooting for the fall of the rapidly changing fashion cycles, whether it be for economic reasons or otherwise. These fast fashion clothes are such poor quality that a lot of the time the material just feels awful to wear and doesn\\'t hold up in the wash, and people are going to get tired of it. I know I\\'m tired of having perfectly usable clothes from 5-10 years ago that look \"dated\" according to hoards of brands and influencers that are pushing polyester trash.\\n\\nThis really struck a nerve for me when I bought a brand new activewear sweater for $50, maybe $30 after some coupons and rebates I had to hunt down. The material felt like what kids\\' Halloween costumes were made from 10-20 years ago. I refuse to believe this is the standard that the average person will find acceptable. | I think we as a society should also adjust to having less clothing. Nobody really \"needs\" 20 sweaters or 10 pairs of jeans at one time, and never in history have closets been as big as they are now. \\n\\nI was reading a book on historical fashion trends, and people in the past, even the well-off, made do with one or two made-to-measure dresses or suits a year. I also think back to the often quoted statistic that people have been buying 60% more clothing since 2000. Currently trying to downsize my wardrobe, and if I were to only own 5 sweaters at one given time, $300 for a nice cashmere piece that would last me years doesn\\'t seem too outlandish. | I’ve just been buying vintage or waiting to purchase until Labor Day/Black Friday/etc sales roll around. Yes things are overpriced relative to their quality nowadays but oftentimes a BF sale will bring the price down to (at least close to) a fair one relative to the quality. Or buy vintage- I have lots of nice wool, merino, angora, etc even cashmere sweaters all <$50 on Poshmark. And since they are vintage they are high quality, even compared to a brand new 100% wool sweater (or whatever material).'}\n",

But not necessarily in the bag charm way. For me, “personalization” means carefully curating items from the resale market that align with my personal style/lifestyle. I’ve been collecting avant-garde styles from Junya Watanabe, Rei Kawakubo, Margiela, etc. that don’t necessarily conform to trends—and even when they do, they’re things that align with my personal style, like oversized tailoring. Because I’m buying them years after they first appeared, fewer people are wearing them (and I’m getting a nice discount). And because they have unexpected design elements, it’s difficult to place them in any era….so they are timeless in their own way. So I’ll continue doing that in the 2025 and beyond. | Depends on what you consider rich I guess.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe richest people in the world haven't changed nor are likely to change their clothing styles.

I then make as many different outfits as I can with that item. When I feel like I can’t come up with anything else, I move on to another item and repeat. If an item hardly goes with anything else in my closet, I may consider donating it. \\n\\n- Using the random outfit generator, I play around till something sparks an idea. Rarely will the generator come up with a whole outfit that works, but seeing, for example, this skirt with that jacket that I never thought about pairing will get me started. \\n\\n- I go through a category of clothing and arrange items according to how long it’s been since I’ve worn them. Like my long-sleeved dresses now have the recently worn items at the bottom so I see the stuff that’s been collecting dust at the top of the page and am more tempted to wear those items. \\n\\n- I go through entire categories after a season has passed and see what I never got around to wearing. I’ll consider if there was a valid reason (formal dress with no formal events that season will get a pass; one sundress unworn when I wore other sundresses repeatedly, no pass) and donate items I clearly made no effort to wear. \\n\\n- When shopping, I open the app and see what all I can match up with an item I’m considering buying. Helps me avoid purchases I’ll never wear. \\n\\n- I look through my most worn items for themes. I tend to get the most use out of purses, jackets, and boots in bright colors. This guides me when I’m considering spending a little more on something that fits one of those categories.\\n\\n- I look through my cost per wear list and assess where my mistakes are happening. Some items are worth extra money and some rarely are. This often coincides with most/least worn items but not always. A super cheap item is still a bit useless if I only use it once, and an expensive item that I won’t use often is also better to avoid. \\n\\n- There’s a notes section on each item & I use it to type in words like “thrifted” or “new” so I can search those terms and see if I’m maintaining my preference for a mostly thrifted wardrobe. I also type in the purchase date of an item so I have some frame of reference if an item is on my rarely worn list. Seeing you’ve owned something for 5 years and worn it once hits different than misremembering you bought it 2 years ago. | I’ve been wondering this myself as well! I use Stylebook and I mostly use it for knowing what items I wear most, when the last time I wore something was, but honestly the packing feature is my absolute favorite.\\n\\nIt’s also very enlightening to see what gets worn the least, and I now know to cull these items for my ongoing purge. It’s hard to argue with worn history facts!\\n\\nWhat I do not inventory & track:\\n- Earrings\\n- Activewear (including workout-only shoes)\\n- Pajamas / at home only loungewear\\n- Socks, bras, underwear, hosiery\\n- Gloves, hats and other seasonal accessories I rarely wear\\n- Swimwear\\n\\nI go back and forth on whether it’d be helpful to start inventorying/tracking activewear, though. I have so much, and work out often enough that I’d get something out of it, but I don’t want to burden my daily life by having to log everything. Definitely curious to hear what others are doing! | I've been using cataloguing my wardrobe as motivation to also do the wardrobe purge/reorganization I've been meaning to do for like a year. I just completely emptied out my entire dresser and I've logged almost all of it, even the stuff that I hardly ever wear. For the things that I was already kind of on the fence about, if I couldn't even bring myself to take a picture of them, that was a pretty clear final sign that I could let it go. My drawers are already SO MUCH ROOMIER y'all. \\n\\nBut I only started about a month ago; have a feeling that, after a year or so, I'll have a much easier time letting go of those edge cases that I kept but already kinda know I shouldn't have. And I'm also hoping it will help me discover new possibilities for older pieces that I haven't been wearing but still feel like I need—who knows? Maybe they'll be my new-old staples.\\n\\nIt also helps that I'm really good at remembering facts about my clothing. I remember where and when I bought things and approximately how much I paid back through about 2018 or so—couldn't tell you why, but it's useful. Maybe because that's when I started selling seriously on Poshmark, which completely upended my relationship with shopping? That Poshmark experience also helps in that I'm really comfy with photographing/editing clothing AND/OR quickly finding stock photos for stuff I know that I own. I've definitely used stock photos for things I've bought recently because I knew I could find them through my email receipts or Shop app aaaand that's easier than dragging the thing out and actually taking a decent picture. But taking one picture is so much easier than taking a bunch that are good enough to post something for sale, so it still feels weirdly easy to me.\\n\\nAaaaand also now I'm kinda hooked on the analytics, so I've been logging everything, more or less. Workout outfit that I changed into in the middle of the work day? YES. Lazy WFH athleisure outfit that I intended to go to yoga in later and then flaked on? (Cough today cough) Still logged it, because I like these pieces and I want them to get credit. Is that weird? Yes. ***But the analytics.***\\n\\nETA: part of what's keeping me motivated is that I'm using Indyx and I intend to use their stylist feature once I have everything logged. I think having fresh eyes on my wardrobe will be really interesting and will help with that whole goal of re-integrating pieces that have potential but I haven't figured out how to wear.\"}\n",

I know they look completely different colors, but I feel like they’re a similar style to each other with layering a shirt underneath. The black one is velvet and the camel one is wool. Which one is more versatile to wear through out the year? Ideas on how to style them so that they wouldn’t look so similar to each other? Which one has your vote? Or do I go crazy and get both of them since it’s my birthday soon and I deserve it.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gkiqd2r687e1.jpeg?width=1266&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d65b761f9a998826b13d4b4d2f07da9793d26f28 | How much should quality new clothing cost? I often see people complaining about having to spend more than $20 on jeans and $30 on a sweater. But when talking about more ethically made clothing made from quality materials, should clothes be more in the $50-$300 range?\\n\\nI’ll use Asket as an example since they list the actual prices for raw materials, manufacturing, and markup.

If I wear it twice a week for half the year, that\\'s still just about 50 wears.  I might realistically wear it 25 times the second year, and maybe even less frequently the third year. \\n\\nIt\\'s something I\\'ve decided to start tracking, and to consider when I make my purchases. Since I quite fast fashion, I buy fewer, better clothes, and I\\'ve never been happier with my wardrobe. But I realized recently that I also need to get rid of that fast fashion mindset that more is always better. \\n\\nAnyone else interested in the 100 wears idea?', 'images_processed': None, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hava5s/wearing_every_piece_100_times/', 'section': 'hot', 'created_utc': 1733810766.0, 'top_comments': \"I have been tracking everything I wear for five and a half years, since July 2019, and you are SO right that we tend to overestimate how much we wear stuff! When I started, I guessed how many times I had worn stuff before I started tracking but after tracking for a while, I cut all those guesses WAY down in my spreadsheet. Even my favourite blouse, which I had thought of myself as wearing on repeat, I wore only 4 or 5 times in the first six months. But now most of my clothes have been bought since then and have completely accurate tracking. On my tracker, I have columns that go green at 30 wears, 50 wears and 100 wears. I also track cost per wear - I absolutely LOVE it when it's less than £1 per wear!\\n\\n\\nSince I started tracking, I have been cutting my wardrobe down by honestly more than 90% - I had about 2000 things when I started. I'm aiming for 88 items in my capsule wardrobe, including everything except pyjamas, underwear and jewellery (I have very few pieces). I'm very close! Also nothing helped me discover my personal style than tracking my wears. It shows you so clearly what you love to wear, in black and white data. \\n\\n\\n100 wears is a really good goal but it just won't be possible for lots of stuff - it will just fall apart by then, it's sad to say. But wearing it until it's worn out is an achievement in itself! I consider it worthwhile after 30 wears and/or £1 (or $1 or €1) per wear. It can take a LONG time to hit either of those goals, even with relatively cheap things, and it's really helping me change my shopping habits.\\n\\n\\nAfter a few years of really cutting back on clothes shopping, I bought too much this year, and I'm trying to be brave enough to do a complete clothes no buy next year. My other wardrobe goal for 2025 is to wear EVERYTHING I own at least 10 times. It's a tough but achievable goal for almost everything, with the exception of a couple of specialised items. I will reassess everything I own that doesn't get worn that much at the end of the year. It's a quantifiable commitment to loving and using what I own! | While I haven’t intentionally thought I need to wear my items 100 times each, I do track my wardrobe through Stylebook and see I’ve long surpassed that with many items. [My most worn items](https://imgur.com/a/7HdWDDM) shows a lot of purses, rain boots (often needed at work), a pair of jeans, and a few clothing items worth discussing. \\n\\nThe purple dress worn 64 times is from a fast fashion shop people love to shit on for selling clothes that “fall apart after a few wears,” and it’s still in excellent condition. The black dress worn 61 days is from a Target brand, but I purchased it at Goodwill, meaning its true number of wears is likely higher. It’s also still in excellent condition. My fit & flare puffer coat worn 45 days still looks new; it was a splurge (for me, a poor person) from Venus after I waited for a sale and coupon code to align. \\n\\nLike anyone, I do have items in my closet I’ve worn only once (my least worn tab in Stylebook shames me), but I try and learn a lesson from each of those purchases. Am I buying impractical items? Fancy open-toe shoes, for instance, do they really fit into my life when I need closed shoes for work and only get to wear open-toe heels for nights out during the few months of warm weather where I live? Do I really need multiple colors of this type of shoe, when just a pair in silver would cover the majority of my going out summer looks? Admittedly, I own open-toe heels in many colors, a lot of them purchased when I worked a different job, but these questions can stop me from continuing to acquire more.\\n\\nIf I need a formal dress I don’t expect to wear more than a few times, I get it from a thrift shop, take care of it, and donate it back when I’m done with it. Short sequined or metallic dresses actually get a decent amount of use in my closet, so I’m more flexible with buying those. I’ve acquired a few recently that I still haven’t worn, so I’ve stopped buying more and am looking for opportunities to wear the ones I already own in pink, red, green, gold, and rainbow. Not even a party in the club every night kind of gal needs more colors than that. (Totally revealing my age with the thought that women still wear sequined dresses to a club, ha.) I wear them to parties, festive theatre events, and sometimes even casually with the right styling. \\n\\nMy goal is to get my cost per wear down to $1 or less on everything. Some items are easy due to their low starting cost, but it helps justify the larger purchases when it’s something I really need, like orthotic sandals or a winter coat. My current [lowest cost per wear list](https://imgur.com/a/oThKNEh) shows decent overlap with my most worn items but also reveals some items that just started off unbelievably cheap to begin with, like a silk turtleneck sweater I found at the Goodwill outlet where you pay by the pound. \\n\\nAll this said, no matter my goals of wearing items many times and driving down their cost per wear, if I discover I really don’t like something after I bought it and do not see myself forcing its use (usually an ill-fitting or horribly uncomfortable item), I donate right away. I’m big on not keeping a lot of clutter around and want someone else to be able to enjoy the item while it’s still practically new and in fashion. | Love this idea! I’ve been sort of trying to do this to justify my more expensive purchases as I ween off of fast fashion by utilizing a rough “Cost Per Wear”. I had a hard time justifying these expensive jeans but they’re such good quality and look amazing and I’ve worn them probably over one hundred times, thus bringing the cost per wear down to 1$ roughly. Meanwhile there are bodysuits in my closet that Im ashamed to admit I’ve never worn that have a 20$ CPW.\"}\n",

The coats were always their bread and butter but I've noticed a difference in the material between old TB coats and one purchased last year - they're certainly not worth what they charge anymore.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nI'm just so curious what other people think.

It can take FOREVER for clothes to sell if you\\'re not making an active effort. By the time your stuff sells, you were probably looking to donate it anyway. In the meantime, your item can rack up \"likes\" or \"bookmarks\" so that when you are ready to sell, you can send out an offer to dozens of people and hopefully get rid of that piece right away. \\n\\n2. Only selling when you want to get rid of something is time consuming and usually gets you less money. \\n\\n3. Having the stock photos and information catalogued makes it easier to sell than a few years later when you\\'re struggling to find the original listing and specs online. Right or wrong, stock photos and website info really increases the value of used clothes. \\n\\n4. The listings themselves are a good way to keep track of what you have in your closet. \\n\\n5. For those following a \"$1/wear\" rule, listing right away makes it easier to recoup the remaining amount you need to \"break even\" if you\\'re not really wearing something a lot. \\n\\n6. It\\'s way more environmentally friendly to give your old clothes a new home than it is to donate it, where there\\'s a decent chance it won\\'t be reused. \\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Something might sell before you want to get rid of it. At that point you either need to cancel the order or part with something prematurely. \\n\\n2. It has the psychological impact of making clothes feel disposable and creates a norm in which people cycle through clothes incredibly quickly and overconsume under the guise of \"eh I can just sell it\". In a way it\\'s good that it\\'s so f\\\\*cking hard to sell used clothes, because it makes you think twice and thrice about whether you want to click \"buy\". \\n\\n3. For those struggling to control a budding shopping addiction, selling and thus spending time on selling apps can aggravate the problem. \\n\\n4. You might sell something that you later realize you still wanted because you impulsively leapt at the money, or you might be dissatisfied with what you have because you see the dollar sign and that piece starts to feel like wasted money that could be liquidated.

Both your body and the garments. Understanding if you have long/short/balanced torso and legs can be a helpful starting point. Then look at the proportions of the garment: some oversized tshirts emphasize the arm width and length, others are cut to have more length in the body or width. Depending on what you’re pairing it with it will change the visual “weight” of the outfit and emphasize different features. Some people use the rule of “big top, little bottoms” or “little top, big bottoms” to achieve balance but it doesn’t always work well (for me). Tucking, rolling sleeves, material composition and drape, and undergarments also make a big difference. (Sorry not a straightforward answer 😅) | This answer is not super helpful but I think it depends a lot on context. When I go to hip hop class and everyone is wearing baggy-on-baggy streetwear, I feel so natural wearing all baggy too and I feel really wrong and self-conscious wearing something tight fitting. Vs if I go to another thing where everyone is wearing leggings or mini skirts, and I wear baggy cargo pants and hoodie, I look silly and like I didn’t make an effort. | Like already stated knowing what works on your proportions are the first part- I’m 5’2” with a short waist, no boobs, and a very straight build (like a brick, lol), and I love love love oversized. Just can’t be wearing the same stuff as a willowy 5’8” person. \\n\\nBut also fabric choice is huge. Many button downs are too stiff and look like a sloppy trapeze if they are worn oversize ( but again, probably fine on tall and thin), whereas a finer fabric with more drape would work better. Same for pants too, fabric with more movement that hangs better can look great. When I’m wearing big knits, I always make sure my pants are more drapey or stick with flares to kinda balance out the oversize top so I don’t look like Im trying to walk on tiny toothpick legs \\n\\nPlus, accessories are always helpful'}\n",

I am 51 and decided what am I waiting for, I’m going to have some fun and who cares. I bought myself some cool adidas gazelles I had been eyeing, some bright colored sweaters, and jeans. I feel more like me than I have in years. Some of the outfits I’ve put together are out of my comfort zone-a blazer with a bright shirt, jeans, flats and a statement necklace. Totally not my usual style but it has challenged me to have confidence. All this to say, I think clothes are a great place to have fun and express one’s self. At the same time stay true to yourself. Kind of a place where the two meet. | I\\'ve grappled with this for a fair bit. When I was younger, I lived in the city, worked in a museum, and generally had a really unique style. I took a lot of risks, bought really interesting pieces, and was proud to be known as a fashionable, stylish person. I also had more of a \"going out\" lifestyle where I was able to really push the envelope with my outfits. Fast forward to now and my work is either done at home or in the field in rural or otherwise less developed areas. I don\\'t do as much going out (due to my travel schedule and my friend network being much more scattered these days) and so my wardrobe has really shifted to more athletic, travel-type clothes that can pack down into a tiny bag and be washed in a sink.\\n\\nIn my heart though, I\\'m still that girl who loves putting together unique outfits and I really miss her. It took a slightly tipsy post happy hour mild meltdown in a Zara where I told my friend that I was so sad because \"I miss dressing pretty and all I wear are UGLY ADVENTURE CLOTHES\" to help me re-orient things and try to incorporate my need to be styled into my lifestyle of trekking around in the jungle. I leaned into neutral color palettes with unique pieces of jewelry, hats, or scarves to give my look some character.

Lately it was one about Aritzia that inspired this post. And it\\'s objectively true. But I think it\\'s not just a matter of brands being greedy, there are real external forces - ecological, political, and economical - that means we are never getting a $20 white cotton t-shirt that will last 10 years anymore. \\n\\nWhat\\'s happening at Aritzia is happening at pretty much all mid- and low- end fashion brands. Costs have gone way up, from cotton prices (yay climate change!) to higher rents, higher labour and shipping costs, and soon more tariffs, so if they wanted to maintain the same quality they would need to raise prices A LOT. But wages haven\\'t kept up, so if they did that, people would buy fewer pieces because they can\\'t afford more. Brands are faced with two choices: A) maintain quality, increase price, and sell fewer pieces; or B) decrease quality. maintain prices, and sell more pieces. Many in the fast fashion world are going route B) because they would lose their customers otherwise, while those in the luxury fashion segment tend to have gone for route A) because their customers can absorb higher price increases. One notable exception is Banana Republic that has gone for route A). \\n\\nThere is one \"loophole\", kind of, of up-and-coming brands who are in that early high-growth phase of trying to gain customers at all costs before they start worrying too much about profitability. But this is a phase rather than a category, and as soon as they get popular enough they\\'re going to have to make the same tough decisions. \\n\\nMy question is how are you adjusting to this reality? Are you buying less, or accepting lower quality? I\\'m trying to buy better and buy less, but honestly \"buying better\" costs a LOT more than I was ready for. Instead of paying $80 for a sweater that is equivalent to the quality of a $50 sweater ten years ago, it\\'s more like $250. I\\'ve had to make some tough decisions about not buying the trendy thing I wanted simply because I can\\'t afford to drop that kind of money on something that might be outdated in a couple of years.

I know I\\'m tired of having perfectly usable clothes from 5-10 years ago that look \"dated\" according to hoards of brands and influencers that are pushing polyester trash.\\n\\nThis really struck a nerve for me when I bought a brand new activewear sweater for $50, maybe $30 after some coupons and rebates I had to hunt down. The material felt like what kids\\' Halloween costumes were made from 10-20 years ago. I refuse to believe this is the standard that the average person will find acceptable. | I think we as a society should also adjust to having less clothing. Nobody really \"needs\" 20 sweaters or 10 pairs of jeans at one time, and never in history have closets been as big as they are now. \\n\\nI was reading a book on historical fashion trends, and people in the past, even the well-off, made do with one or two made-to-measure dresses or suits a year. I also think back to the often quoted statistic that people have been buying 60% more clothing since 2000. Currently trying to downsize my wardrobe, and if I were to only own 5 sweaters at one given time, $300 for a nice cashmere piece that would last me years doesn\\'t seem too outlandish. | I’ve just been buying vintage or waiting to purchase until Labor Day/Black Friday/etc sales roll around. Yes things are overpriced relative to their quality nowadays but oftentimes a BF sale will bring the price down to (at least close to) a fair one relative to the quality.

And since they are vintage they are high quality, even compared to a brand new 100% wool sweater (or whatever material).'}\n",

      "  \"top_comments\": \"I don\\u2019t know how it compares, but here are some fun ways I use Stylebook:\\n\\n- Using the outfit tab, I start with any clothing item (skirt, top, whatever). I then make as many different outfits as I can with that item. When I feel like I can\\u2019t come up with anything else, I move on to another item and repeat. If an item hardly goes with anything else in my closet, I may consider donating it. \\n\\n- Using the random outfit generator, I play around till something sparks an idea. Rarely will the generator come up with a whole outfit that works, but seeing, for example, this skirt with that jacket that I never thought about pairing will get me started. \\n\\n- I go through a category of clothing and arrange items according to how long it\\u2019s been since I\\u2019ve worn them. Like my long-sleeved dresses now have the recently worn items at the bottom so I see the stuff that\\u2019s been collecting dust at the top of the page and am more tempted to wear those items. \\n\\n- I go through entire categories after a season has passed and see what I never got around to wearing. I\\u2019ll consider if there was a valid reason (formal dress with no formal events that season will get a pass; one sundress unworn when I wore other sundresses repeatedly, no pass) and donate items I clearly made no effort to wear. \\n\\n- When shopping, I open the app and see what all I can match up with an item I\\u2019m considering buying. Helps me avoid purchases I\\u2019ll never wear. \\n\\n- I look through my most worn items for themes. I tend to get the most use out of purses, jackets, and boots in bright colors. This guides me when I\\u2019m considering spending a little more on something that fits one of those categories.\\n\\n- I look through my cost per wear list and assess where my mistakes are happening. Some items are worth extra money and some rarely are. This often coincides with most/least worn items but not always. A super cheap item is still a bit useless if I only use it once, and an expensive item that I won\\u2019t use often is also better to avoid. \\n\\n- There\\u2019s a notes section on each item & I use it to type in words like \\u201cthrifted\\u201d or \\u201cnew\\u201d so I can search those terms and see if I\\u2019m maintaining my preference for a mostly thrifted wardrobe. I also type in the purchase date of an item so I have some frame of reference if an item is on my rarely worn list. Seeing you\\u2019ve owned something for 5 years and worn it once hits different than misremembering you bought it 2 years ago. | I\\u2019ve been wondering this myself as well! I use Stylebook and I mostly use it for knowing what items I wear most, when the last time I wore something was, but honestly the packing feature is my absolute favorite.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s also very enlightening to see what gets worn the least, and I now know to cull these items for my ongoing purge. It\\u2019s hard to argue with worn history facts!\\n\\nWhat I do not inventory & track:\\n- Earrings\\n- Activewear (including workout-only shoes)\\n- Pajamas / at home only loungewear\\n- Socks, bras, underwear, hosiery\\n- Gloves, hats and other seasonal accessories I rarely wear\\n- Swimwear\\n\\nI go back and forth on whether it\\u2019d be helpful to start inventorying/tracking activewear, though. I have so much, and work out often enough that I\\u2019d get something out of it, but I don\\u2019t want to burden my daily life by having to log everything. Definitely curious to hear what others are doing! | I've been using cataloguing my wardrobe as motivation to also do the wardrobe purge/reorganization I've been meaning to do for like a year. I just completely emptied out my entire dresser and I've logged almost all of it, even the stuff that I hardly ever wear. For the things that I was already kind of on the fence about, if I couldn't even bring myself to take a picture of them, that was a pretty clear final sign that I could let it go. My drawers are already SO MUCH ROOMIER y'all. \\n\\nBut I only started about a month ago; have a feeling that, after a year or so, I'll have a much easier time letting go of those edge cases that I kept but already kinda know I shouldn't have. And I'm also hoping it will help me discover new possibilities for older pieces that I haven't been wearing but still feel like I need\\u2014who knows? Maybe they'll be my new-old staples.\\n\\nIt also helps that I'm really good at remembering facts about my clothing. I remember where and when I bought things and approximately how much I paid back through about 2018 or so\\u2014couldn't tell you why, but it's useful. Maybe because that's when I started selling seriously on Poshmark, which completely upended my relationship with shopping? That Poshmark experience also helps in that I'm really comfy with photographing/editing clothing AND/OR quickly finding stock photos for stuff I know that I own. I've definitely used stock photos for things I've bought recently because I knew I could find them through my email receipts or Shop app aaaand that's easier than dragging the thing out and actually taking a decent picture. But taking one picture is so much easier than taking a bunch that are good enough to post something for sale, so it still feels weirdly easy to me.\\n\\nAaaaand also now I'm kinda hooked on the analytics, so I've been logging everything, more or less. Workout outfit that I changed into in the middle of the work day? YES. Lazy WFH athleisure outfit that I intended to go to yoga in later and then flaked on? (Cough today cough) Still logged it, because I like these pieces and I want them to get credit. Is that weird? Yes. ***But the analytics.***\\n\\nETA: part of what's keeping me motivated is that I'm using Indyx and I intend to use their stylist feature once I have everything logged. I think having fresh eyes on my wardrobe will be really interesting and will help with that whole goal of re-integrating pieces that have potential but I haven't figured out how to wear.\"\n",

I posted the other day about wearing velvet not in the holiday season and received some great feedback. I went to order this lovely velvet dress and saw that a new dress in a similar style had just been released. I absolutely love both of them. I know they look completely different colors, but I feel like they\\u2019re a similar style to each other with layering a shirt underneath. The black one is velvet and the camel one is wool. Which one is more versatile to wear through out the year? Ideas on how to style them so that they wouldn\\u2019t look so similar to each other? Which one has your vote? Or do I go crazy and get both of them since it\\u2019s my birthday soon and I deserve it.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gkiqd2r687e1.jpeg?width=1266&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d65b761f9a998826b13d4b4d2f07da9793d26f28 | How much should quality new clothing cost? I often see people complaining about having to spend more than $20 on jeans and $30 on a sweater. But when talking about more ethically made clothing made from quality materials, should clothes be more in the $50-$300 range?\\n\\nI\\u2019ll use Asket as an example since they list the actual prices for raw materials, manufacturing, and markup. This is a merino wool turtleneck that\\u2019s $115, which is pretty typical for brands in this tier.\\n\\nI realize a cheaper and sustainable alternative is to just buy secondhand, but in this case I\\u2019m talking about buying new, which is what people commonly do.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2y39e58la7e1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ce600daea04a0384985657400cd3d94ce630ca9 | I need help learning how to style these new items in my wardrobe in creative ways:\\n\\n1. Slightly cropped, leather brown snakeskin wide pants (other than black turtleneck + black boots, which is too simple for my taste)\\n2. Fake suede mid-thigh length dark purple coat (https://en.zalando.de/hallhuber-short-coat-purple-zir01tvmt-001.html)\\n3. Grey-ish blue office slacks (straight-legged, slightly cropped; thrifted)\\n\\nMy style is classic with a twist. No quiet luxury for me, I like an edge, I dont experiment with silhouettes, I wear lots of blues and greens and blacks.\\n\\nThank you very much!\"\n",

On the other extreme (but much rarer) you have people who only buy thrifted clothes once every ten years and don't care about fashion. \\n\\nI quit fast fashion, including Zara and H&M, about three years ago, and I was thinking about what more realistic action might look like for a person with an urban job that requires them to be put together, besides give up new clothes entirely. What can a person do who still wants to buy new clothes but wants to do so more responsibly. The thing I came up with was the commitment to wear everything I buy at least 100 times. I know some people have done a \\\"30 wears\\\" challenge, but that just doesn't seem like enough to me. What about when you buy something, you have to have an idea that it will be possible to wear it at least 100 times before it goes out of style, wears out, you get sick of it, etc. In most instances this will mean it has to be in your wardrobe for at least a few years and get pretty regular wear.\\n\\nI'm certainly not the first person to come up with this, but I was thinking about how it would change one's dressing and shopping habits. This Swedish data guy [tracked all his clothing purchases and wears](https://www.reaktor.com/articles/why-ive-tracked-every-single-piece-of-clothing-ive-worn-for-three-years?utm_source=pocket_saves)  and realized that he vastly overestimated how much he was actually wearing most of his clothes. We so often think that we need more than we do. I got a new sweater recently, and after it was a success after a few wears, I immediately started thinking along the lines of  \\\"hey I should really get at least one more of these,\\\" because if one is good, two or three is better, right? But then I started thinking about the 100 wears idea, and realized it would be a lot harder to wear that sweater 100 times if there were one or two more of them, even in different colors. I'm not saying it's always a bad idea to have multiples of something, but questioning the assumption seemed important. If I wear it twice a week for half the year, that's still just about 50 wears.  I might realistically wear it 25 times the second year, and maybe even less frequently the third year. \\n\\nIt's something I've decided to start tracking, and to consider when I make my purchases. Since I quite fast fashion, I buy fewer, better clothes, and I've never been happier with my wardrobe. But I realized recently that I also need to get rid of that fast fashion mindset that more is always better. \\n\\nAnyone else interested in the 100 wears idea?\",\n",

      "  \"top_comments\": \"I have been tracking everything I wear for five and a half years, since July 2019, and you are SO right that we tend to overestimate how much we wear stuff! When I started, I guessed how many times I had worn stuff before I started tracking but after tracking for a while, I cut all those guesses WAY down in my spreadsheet. Even my favourite blouse, which I had thought of myself as wearing on repeat, I wore only 4 or 5 times in the first six months. But now most of my clothes have been bought since then and have completely accurate tracking. On my tracker, I have columns that go green at 30 wears, 50 wears and 100 wears. I also track cost per wear - I absolutely LOVE it when it's less than \\u00a31 per wear!\\n\\n\\nSince I started tracking, I have been cutting my wardrobe down by honestly more than 90% - I had about 2000 things when I started. I'm aiming for 88 items in my capsule wardrobe, including everything except pyjamas, underwear and jewellery (I have very few pieces). I'm very close! Also nothing helped me discover my personal style than tracking my wears. It shows you so clearly what you love to wear, in black and white data. \\n\\n\\n100 wears is a really good goal but it just won't be possible for lots of stuff - it will just fall apart by then, it's sad to say. But wearing it until it's worn out is an achievement in itself! I consider it worthwhile after 30 wears and/or \\u00a31 (or $1 or \\u20ac1) per wear. It can take a LONG time to hit either of those goals, even with relatively cheap things, and it's really helping me change my shopping habits.\\n\\n\\nAfter a few years of really cutting back on clothes shopping, I bought too much this year, and I'm trying to be brave enough to do a complete clothes no buy next year. My other wardrobe goal for 2025 is to wear EVERYTHING I own at least 10 times. It's a tough but achievable goal for almost everything, with the exception of a couple of specialised items. I will reassess everything I own that doesn't get worn that much at the end of the year. It's a quantifiable commitment to loving and using what I own! | While I haven\\u2019t intentionally thought I need to wear my items 100 times each, I do track my wardrobe through Stylebook and see I\\u2019ve long surpassed that with many items. [My most worn items](https://imgur.com/a/7HdWDDM) shows a lot of purses, rain boots (often needed at work), a pair of jeans, and a few clothing items worth discussing. \\n\\nThe purple dress worn 64 times is from a fast fashion shop people love to shit on for selling clothes that \\u201cfall apart after a few wears,\\u201d and it\\u2019s still in excellent condition. The black dress worn 61 days is from a Target brand, but I purchased it at Goodwill, meaning its true number of wears is likely higher. It\\u2019s also still in excellent condition. My fit & flare puffer coat worn 45 days still looks new; it was a splurge (for me, a poor person) from Venus after I waited for a sale and coupon code to align. \\n\\nLike anyone, I do have items in my closet I\\u2019ve worn only once (my least worn tab in Stylebook shames me), but I try and learn a lesson from each of those purchases. Am I buying impractical items? Fancy open-toe shoes, for instance, do they really fit into my life when I need closed shoes for work and only get to wear open-toe heels for nights out during the few months of warm weather where I live? Do I really need multiple colors of this type of shoe, when just a pair in silver would cover the majority of my going out summer looks? Admittedly, I own open-toe heels in many colors, a lot of them purchased when I worked a different job, but these questions can stop me from continuing to acquire more.\\n\\nIf I need a formal dress I don\\u2019t expect to wear more than a few times, I get it from a thrift shop, take care of it, and donate it back when I\\u2019m done with it. Short sequined or metallic dresses actually get a decent amount of use in my closet, so I\\u2019m more flexible with buying those. I\\u2019ve acquired a few recently that I still haven\\u2019t worn, so I\\u2019ve stopped buying more and am looking for opportunities to wear the ones I already own in pink, red, green, gold, and rainbow. Not even a party in the club every night kind of gal needs more colors than that. (Totally revealing my age with the thought that women still wear sequined dresses to a club, ha.) I wear them to parties, festive theatre events, and sometimes even casually with the right styling. \\n\\nMy goal is to get my cost per wear down to $1 or less on everything. Some items are easy due to their low starting cost, but it helps justify the larger purchases when it\\u2019s something I really need, like orthotic sandals or a winter coat. My current [lowest cost per wear list](https://imgur.com/a/oThKNEh) shows decent overlap with my most worn items but also reveals some items that just started off unbelievably cheap to begin with, like a silk turtleneck sweater I found at the Goodwill outlet where you pay by the pound. \\n\\nAll this said, no matter my goals of wearing items many times and driving down their cost per wear, if I discover I really don\\u2019t like something after I bought it and do not see myself forcing its use (usually an ill-fitting or horribly uncomfortable item), I donate right away. I\\u2019m big on not keeping a lot of clutter around and want someone else to be able to enjoy the item while it\\u2019s still practically new and in fashion. | Love this idea! I\\u2019ve been sort of trying to do this to justify my more expensive purchases as I ween off of fast fashion by utilizing a rough \\u201cCost Per Wear\\u201d. I had a hard time justifying these expensive jeans but they\\u2019re such good quality and look amazing and I\\u2019ve worn them probably over one hundred times, thus bringing the cost per wear down to 1$ roughly. Meanwhile there are bodysuits in my closet that Im ashamed to admit I\\u2019ve never worn that have a 20$ CPW.\"\n",

Ted Baker filed for bankruptcy. They had been acquired and the infusion of money hadn't been enough to keep them afloat.\\n\\n--------\\n\\nIt seemed like the writing was on the wall that Ted Baker is one brand that can't get away with charging outlandish prices for cheap polyester pieces. Their whole MO appeared to be upscale business casual, a market which took a huge hit through COVID and probably will never recover to its previous dominance. I know a lot of people aren't a fan of Banana Republic's rebranding, but they at least infused a lot more natural materials to try and justify the prices. Today you can look on the Ted Baker website and of the 11 dresses they have, 8 are comprised of 90-100% polyester. These dresses are largely $300-500. What exactly is their game plan? They had a Cyber Monday sale that was just 25% off everything, which is the kind of thing that would make me even less likely to buy something from them full price. The coats were always their bread and butter but I've noticed a difference in the material between old TB coats and one purchased last year - they're certainly not worth what they charge anymore.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nI'm just so curious what other people think.

Gorgeous patterns/botanicals and thick, supple textiles. They were THE house for a sick fit-flare dress that could go office to cocktail hour. \\n\\nBut I looked at their website just now and... wow, no wonder they totally fell off my radar. Not only did they not really evolve their style with the times, they didn't even continue to offer the unique elements that were at the core of their brand DNA. Much of the \\\"new in\\\" section looks clearance-rack bound. Just looks like uninspired, perma-millennial \\\"they're making me go into the office today\\\" wear. And this is totally disregarding materials and pricing. \\n\\nFor others looking to fill the Ted void: I've shifted to new Banana and really been pleased! And for the unique work-to-play pieces I've also become a huge Acler stan. | It looks like the leftovers from when they closed their website a few months back after ongoing clearance sales.  \\n\\nIt's not really clear if the brand has been saved, perhaps it will pick up with the spring/summer range unless this is a last attempt to rid themselves of the winter stock they had at hand at the time before they disappear again.\\n\\nI loved their coats, but their sizing quality control over the past couple of years was really bad, which made it impossible to buy online from overseas, the shipping costs both ways were not worth it.  In Australia, we only ever had a small part of the range available locally.\\n\\nI remember buying one coat online in my usual size and it was huge, exchanged for a size down that was a bit snug, then re-purchased the original size locally at an end of season clearance sale and it was perfect! | It's a shame because I looooooved some of their prints!

It's from the 90's but is definitely giving 1920's flapper meets the Eras Tour and I can't wait to wear it.\\n\\nThe only problem I run into on NYE every year is how cold it is! I've spent several years freezing my butt off or trudging through snow in my heels for the sake of fashion and the one night a year I like to really dress up. Thankfully it will be in the 40's (Fahrenheit ) this year, which is still cold but not as bad as years' past. I'm thinking I might be able to get away with some fleece lined tights and a jacket, but it will definitely alter the look I'm going for. It sucks going somewhere where there isn't a coat check and having to keep up with your coat all night.\\n\\nWhat are your plans for NYE and how do you intend to dress? Are there certain things that people wear in your culture or country? For those of you in chilly weather that may have to spend some time outdoors, how are you dressing?\",\n",

My most flagrant wtf purchase was a silk velvet dressing gown from Toast:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8piojzmce0ae1.jpeg?width=1451&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fecd82039b2a4c4eb1878c395e5f9255c5056279\\n\\nAs I seem to spend half my morning in PJs these days, at least I can greet the postman in style. Also from Toast I bought some [sleeveless PJs](https://www.toa.st/cdn/shop/files/NPJUW06_1_720x.jpg) that go with the gown, and a charcoal [loop pile sweatshirt and baggy pants](https://www.toa.st/cdn/shop/files/LLTTW08_2_68692759-d264-484d-a576-a0b38af94034_720x.jpg) for further loafing. Very pleased with the quality of all of these, a bargain at sale prices.\\n\\nFrom Zara I got some[ leopard print Birkalikes](https://www.zara.com/uk/en/animal-print-leather-flat-sandals-p12613410.html) that make a more stylish indoor-outdoor slipper than my current Crocs. I wasn't intending to make a capsule leisure wardrobe, so it's a bonus that all these pieces go well together. It really lifts my spirits to be well-dressed, even if I'm just sitting on my own with the laptop.\\n\\nWhile I was perusing The White Company's online sale for towels, I found [these short black biker boots](https://www.thewhitecompany.com/uk/Leather-Biker-Ankle-Boots/p/A11606), which are exactly what I've been seeking for a couple of years to wear with dresses. I never think to look at TWC for fashion, but a lot of their stuff is really nice quality for the price, if a little plain. I actually walk in my footwear, so I much prefer a chunky boot to the delicate slender heeled ones that are currently trending, and biker boots look fresher than a lot of other styles. \\n\\nAt Uniqlo I lucked out on some half price Heattech turtlenecks, a staple for me. Also a pair of Heattech leggings-trousers, which are ideal to tuck into boots for those chilly early morning dogwalks.  However the [moulded bra](https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E464333-000/02) I ordered was a flop - far too wide in the band and too small in the cups despite being technically my correct size. | https://preview.redd.it/8btdbnovp0ae1.jpeg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dab542c0d0eeb8412e056b31b867e5c25a62abea\\n\\nI thrifted this 100 percent wool vintage cardigan (the tag says pr\\u00eat \\u00e0 porter size 12) last week! The pattern and material really stood out to me. I didn\\u2019t know what to wear it with but greens and bell bottom jeans are my ideas \\ud83d\\udca1\"\n",

      "  \"content\": \"I've seen more and more people do this - buy something and list it on a secondhand site for whatever amount you'd accept, even if it's above the list price, and adjust the price as time goes on. \\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. It can take FOREVER for clothes to sell if you're not making an active effort. By the time your stuff sells, you were probably looking to donate it anyway. In the meantime, your item can rack up \\\"likes\\\" or \\\"bookmarks\\\" so that when you are ready to sell, you can send out an offer to dozens of people and hopefully get rid of that piece right away. \\n\\n2. Only selling when you want to get rid of something is time consuming and usually gets you less money. \\n\\n3. Having the stock photos and information catalogued makes it easier to sell than a few years later when you're struggling to find the original listing and specs online. Right or wrong, stock photos and website info really increases the value of used clothes. \\n\\n4. The listings themselves are a good way to keep track of what you have in your closet. \\n\\n5. For those following a \\\"$1/wear\\\" rule, listing right away makes it easier to recoup the remaining amount you need to \\\"break even\\\" if you're not really wearing something a lot. \\n\\n6. It's way more environmentally friendly to give your old clothes a new home than it is to donate it, where there's a decent chance it won't be reused. \\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Something might sell before you want to get rid of it. At that point you either need to cancel the order or part with something prematurely. \\n\\n2. It has the psychological impact of making clothes feel disposable and creates a norm in which people cycle through clothes incredibly quickly and overconsume under the guise of \\\"eh I can just sell it\\\". In a way it's good that it's so f\\\\*cking hard to sell used clothes, because it makes you think twice and thrice about whether you want to click \\\"buy\\\". \\n\\n3. For those struggling to control a budding shopping addiction, selling and thus spending time on selling apps can aggravate the problem. \\n\\n4. You might sell something that you later realize you still wanted because you impulsively leapt at the money, or you might be dissatisfied with what you have because you see the dollar sign and that piece starts to feel like wasted money that could be liquidated. \",\n",

Confidence is a pretty big part of wearing bold stuff and being comfortable in your own skin makes a huge difference. It also takes a degree of emotional energy to handle the extra attention. No, no one's going to assail, spit on you, and call you a harlot causing a need for you to steel yourself before stepping out of the house. There are just days you don't feel like being *that person* and being uncomfortable with it shows. \\n\\nAnother idea of something \\\"wearing you\\\" is that the item is too much or doesn't fit the wearer in the context of the vibe or intention. So if your hair, your makeup, the rest of your outfit says 2010s beige minimalism, high shine PVC spiked goth club platform boots are probably going to be incongruous in a way that stands out negatively.\\nMaking something look cohesive or intentional will serve to make bold items look more natural. | Depending on how balls to the wall you wanna go, it's picking what's going to be the highlight and styling the outfit around it.\\n\\nHaving bridging colours so things feel intentional - like if you want to go for an all red outfit, it's generally smarter and less eye watering to do 1-2 items be a true red, and the rest of the outfit be red adjacent - so burgundies or pinks,  depending on the colour palette you're working with.\\n\\nAnother thing is you have to nail the style and fit before you dial up the colour or prints.   Stuff has to fit right and sit on you nicely before YOU wear the outfit.  If it's ill fitting - too big or too small or badly tailored, the outfit is going to wear you.\\n\\nAnd also it has to be something you LOVE.  If you're not into space and try and wear a galaxy themed outfit, it's just not going to sit as well because you're not loving it. | I honestly can't think of a single time I've seen someone being \\\"worn by their clothes\\\" in normal life. When I think about times I've seen that, it's formal events or celebrity red carpets, when people are visibly overwhelmed by something uncomfortable that they don't really know how to wear. I've never seen someone be overshadowed by an outfit they're happy in. They might look worse in a certain outfit (in my opinion, not that it matters), but worse isn't the same as overshadowed or overwhelmed.\"\n",

They were such awful, awful, and poorly-made dresses.\\n\\nI miss when they had nicer products. :') | I'm fighting the urge to buy one piece from a few fashion houses where the creative director is leaving, and I don't own anything currently. The fashion girlie in me wants something from that creative director's time with the brand---Peter Do is leaving Helmut Lang; Hedi Slimane is leaving Celine; John Galliano is leaving Maison Margiela. I'd buy a button-down shirt from HL and MM, and the Heloise medium triomphe canvas shoulder bag from Celine. I'd wear all three pieces, but I don't need any of it ffs.\\n\\nThe struggle is real. | I finally found underwear that fits me a few weeks ago, after bemoaning for years the loss of the American apparel boy brief that were low waisted designed for women. I just realized how happy that makes me. I bought several pairs of the style (bikini from la vie en rose) and it just makes getting dressed so much better. \\n\\nAnd I got rid of all the underwear that were not right that made it hard to dig through my underwear storage and find \\u201cthe ones I ended up wearing anyway.\\u201d\"\n",

      "  \"top_comments\": \"Hi! I\\u2019m in college and recently realized that I have outgrown the style of most of my clothes. I am wanting to get some pieces that feel more grown up but still fun. I mostly wear neutrals and jewel tones in simple patterns, prioritizing 100% natural fibers. My biggest issue has been finding tops that I like. I mostly wear graphic tees, but would love to find options that are slightly more elevated than that. I still am in college, so something that is still casual is preferred. Does anyone have brands or silhouette recommendations? | I am on a weight loss journey. I have lost 148 pounds so far, I plan to lose about 50 more. I've gone from a 4x to XL. My current measurements are 44\\\" bust, 35\\\" waist, 49.5\\\" hips (very pear shaped) and I am 5'5\\\". \\n\\nObviously, the wardrobe shifts have been pretty drastic. But also slow going. I've been shopping at the brands I had to shop at when I was bigger (Torrid, etc.). But they're limited and too pricey for the quality. For the first time, I have options, but I don't know brands.\\n\\nI almost exclusively wear dresses, I usually like them to be mini to tea length (I feel like any longer excentuates my wide hips). I like florals, colors, and really feminine silhouettes. I like more defined waists on my dresses, so I usually lean towards fit and flare. My go-to outfit is black leggings/tights, a dress with some sort of print/design, and a neutral cardigan. Jess from New Girl basically has my ideal closet.\\n\\nAlso, I have a public facing boring government job. I need new work clothes, so I am looking for more professional brands too. I don't want anything low quality, but I don't want to spend a ton on transitionary clothes either. So brands with pieces that are in a more reasonable price range (no more than $50-$100/piece) are where my mind has been.\\n\\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated! | 20 year HS Reunion:\\n\\nSo I have my 20 year HS reunion coming up and I honestly have no idea what people wear to those things, ive only ever seen em on TV!!

      "  \"top_comments\": \"I think it comes down to proportions. Both your body and the garments. Understanding if you have long/short/balanced torso and legs can be a helpful starting point. Then look at the proportions of the garment: some oversized tshirts emphasize the arm width and length, others are cut to have more length in the body or width. Depending on what you\\u2019re pairing it with it will change the visual \\u201cweight\\u201d of the outfit and emphasize different features. Some people use the rule of \\u201cbig top, little bottoms\\u201d or \\u201clittle top, big bottoms\\u201d to achieve balance but it doesn\\u2019t always work well (for me). Tucking, rolling sleeves, material composition and drape, and undergarments also make a big difference. (Sorry not a straightforward answer \\ud83d\\ude05) | This answer is not super helpful but I think it depends a lot on context. When I go to hip hop class and everyone is wearing baggy-on-baggy streetwear, I feel so natural wearing all baggy too and I feel really wrong and self-conscious wearing something tight fitting. Vs if I go to another thing where everyone is wearing leggings or mini skirts, and I wear baggy cargo pants and hoodie, I look silly and like I didn\\u2019t make an effort. | Like already stated knowing what works on your proportions are the first part- I\\u2019m 5\\u20192\\u201d with a short waist, no boobs, and a very straight build (like a brick, lol), and I love love love oversized. Just can\\u2019t be wearing the same stuff as a willowy 5\\u20198\\u201d person. \\n\\nBut also fabric choice is huge. Many button downs are too stiff and look like a sloppy trapeze if they are worn oversize ( but again, probably fine on tall and thin), whereas a finer fabric with more drape would work better. Same for pants too, fabric with more movement that hangs better can look great. When I\\u2019m wearing big knits, I always make sure my pants are more drapey or stick with flares to kinda balance out the oversize top so I don\\u2019t look like Im trying to walk on tiny toothpick legs \\n\\nPlus, accessories are always helpful\"\n",

The companies have taken care of me but I\\u2019m terrified they\\u2019ll cut me off if I keep reporting misdelivery so now all those orders have to be sent to a UPS drop point. So I have no more free shipping from these places bc what I save gets put back into paying for the drop point fee. \\n\\nI did have the strangest almost theft of a lush box in July. It was delivered in front of my apartment door, but when I got there it was nowhere to be found, and it never showed up so I assumed theft. It was found 3 weeks later on a nearby balcony, some unknown jackass moved it there for whatever reason (I assumed they were going to come back to steal it, and never made it)\\n\\nTwo weeks ago a Jcrew delivery and an ASOS delivery showed up at the same time, the ASOS package got jacked but the Jcrew one was left. Fortunately the Jcrew box had the expensive, sold out item. | Inspired by YouTube I just made a Pinterest board called I Didn\\u2019t Do It. I\\u2019m moving all the pins I didn\\u2019t buy and was glad I didn\\u2019t there.

I bought myself some cool adidas gazelles I had been eyeing, some bright colored sweaters, and jeans. I feel more like me than I have in years. Some of the outfits I\\u2019ve put together are out of my comfort zone-a blazer with a bright shirt, jeans, flats and a statement necklace. Totally not my usual style but it has challenged me to have confidence. All this to say, I think clothes are a great place to have fun and express one\\u2019s self. At the same time stay true to yourself. Kind of a place where the two meet. | I've grappled with this for a fair bit. When I was younger, I lived in the city, worked in a museum, and generally had a really unique style. I took a lot of risks, bought really interesting pieces, and was proud to be known as a fashionable, stylish person. I also had more of a \\\"going out\\\" lifestyle where I was able to really push the envelope with my outfits. Fast forward to now and my work is either done at home or in the field in rural or otherwise less developed areas. I don't do as much going out (due to my travel schedule and my friend network being much more scattered these days) and so my wardrobe has really shifted to more athletic, travel-type clothes that can pack down into a tiny bag and be washed in a sink.\\n\\nIn my heart though, I'm still that girl who loves putting together unique outfits and I really miss her. It took a slightly tipsy post happy hour mild meltdown in a Zara where I told my friend that I was so sad because \\\"I miss dressing pretty and all I wear are UGLY ADVENTURE CLOTHES\\\" to help me re-orient things and try to incorporate my need to be styled into my lifestyle of trekking around in the jungle. I leaned into neutral color palettes with unique pieces of jewelry, hats, or scarves to give my look some character. I mix in natural fibers like cotton, linen, and wool with my quick dry athletic wear, which is both super functional and helps me feel put together. When I'm at home, I make it a point to look stylish and put together just about any time I'm leaving the house - I wear all those niece outfits even just to grab a beer with friends. It's my way to trying to have my balance and even if I'm not quite as envelope pushing as I used to be, I feel like I'm still giving my inner fashion girlie the chance to flex. | I'm a 50 year old boring housewife who hardly ever has a reason to dress up but I dress nice every day anyway because I love doing it, it makes me feel good when I look pulled together. You should dress in a way that makes YOU feel good.\"\n",

      "  \"content\": \"I guess this is more of a thought piece than asking for advice, but I'd love to hear your takes on the questions at the end. \\n\\nIn the last few years I've seen posts across several brand subreddits complaining about higher prices and lower quality. Lately it was one about Aritzia that inspired this post. And it's objectively true. But I think it's not just a matter of brands being greedy, there are real external forces - ecological, political, and economical - that means we are never getting a $20 white cotton t-shirt that will last 10 years anymore. \\n\\nWhat's happening at Aritzia is happening at pretty much all mid- and low- end fashion brands. Costs have gone way up, from cotton prices (yay climate change!) to higher rents, higher labour and shipping costs, and soon more tariffs, so if they wanted to maintain the same quality they would need to raise prices A LOT. But wages haven't kept up, so if they did that, people would buy fewer pieces because they can't afford more. Brands are faced with two choices: A) maintain quality, increase price, and sell fewer pieces; or B) decrease quality. maintain prices, and sell more pieces. Many in the fast fashion world are going route B) because they would lose their customers otherwise, while those in the luxury fashion segment tend to have gone for route A) because their customers can absorb higher price increases. One notable exception is Banana Republic that has gone for route A). \\n\\nThere is one \\\"loophole\\\", kind of, of up-and-coming brands who are in that early high-growth phase of trying to gain customers at all costs before they start worrying too much about profitability. But this is a phase rather than a category, and as soon as they get popular enough they're going to have to make the same tough decisions. \\n\\nMy question is how are you adjusting to this reality? Are you buying less, or accepting lower quality? I'm trying to buy better and buy less, but honestly \\\"buying better\\\" costs a LOT more than I was ready for. Instead of paying $80 for a sweater that is equivalent to the quality of a $50 sweater ten years ago, it's more like $250. I've had to make some tough decisions about not buying the trendy thing I wanted simply because I can't afford to drop that kind of money on something that might be outdated in a couple of years. I feel like my wardrobe has gotten more boring as a result, but maybe that's a good thing - fashion cycles now are too fast for anyone to keep up with, including the environment.\",\n",

      "  \"top_comments\": \"Honestly I'm rooting for the fall of the rapidly changing fashion cycles, whether it be for economic reasons or otherwise. These fast fashion clothes are such poor quality that a lot of the time the material just feels awful to wear and doesn't hold up in the wash, and people are going to get tired of it. I know I'm tired of having perfectly usable clothes from 5-10 years ago that look \\\"dated\\\" according to hoards of brands and influencers that are pushing polyester trash.\\n\\nThis really struck a nerve for me when I bought a brand new activewear sweater for $50, maybe $30 after some coupons and rebates I had to hunt down. The material felt like what kids' Halloween costumes were made from 10-20 years ago. I refuse to believe this is the standard that the average person will find acceptable. | I think we as a society should also adjust to having less clothing. Nobody really \\\"needs\\\" 20 sweaters or 10 pairs of jeans at one time, and never in history have closets been as big as they are now. \\n\\nI was reading a book on historical fashion trends, and people in the past, even the well-off, made do with one or two made-to-measure dresses or suits a year. I also think back to the often quoted statistic that people have been buying 60% more clothing since 2000. Currently trying to downsize my wardrobe, and if I were to only own 5 sweaters at one given time, $300 for a nice cashmere piece that would last me years doesn't seem too outlandish. | I\\u2019ve just been buying vintage or waiting to purchase until Labor Day/Black Friday/etc sales roll around. Yes things are overpriced relative to their quality nowadays but oftentimes a BF sale will bring the price down to (at least close to) a fair one relative to the quality. Or buy vintage- I have lots of nice wool, merino, angora, etc even cashmere sweaters all <$50 on Poshmark. And since they are vintage they are high quality, even compared to a brand new 100% wool sweater (or whatever material).\"\n",

I've been wearing only black leggings since like 2010 but this time I went for all colors- red, burgundy and light blue. \\n\\nI also bought two new makeup products from Charlotte Tilbury- the liquid blush in \\\"dream pop\\\" and the hyaluronic lipstick balm in pillow talk. I'm always looking for makeup that looks good without foundation and both pass that test imo. The blush is very pigmented which is great because I like my blush to be very visible. The lipstick is truly a nude lip on me, which I can't decide if I like, but I do like the formula. | Anyone have any cyber Monday sales they purchased or recommend ?

I don't know how to portray that I have arms and can lift things without coming off as defensive or pissed off. I'm thinking about changing my wardrobe to be more masculine but I'm not sure that would work because professional clothes just don't portray \\\"I can cut down a tree please don't ask if I need you to help me with carrying equipment\\\".\\n\\nSo more generally - have you ever been surprised by how people treat you based on your aesthetic and how did you deal with that?\",\n",
