I was looking for a new winter wool coat and it has come down to these two picks.  
I am 180 cm in length and both are of similar quality (2 just has a little kashmir in it)

However I am unsure about the length. I read various opinions online about coat lengths: above the knee or below it and I am unsure which works better.  
I feel that with 2 any dresses or midi skirts will stick out from under it too much and I guess for the price I would prefer something a bit more perfect where I don't feel like my coat is out of place.  
  
Personally I am leaning towards the first, somehow it feels 2 is too short for my length and figure, but I would like some opinions.

Wearing the clothes vs the clothes wearing you,"Hi guys! 

What are your thoughts on styling outfits that don’t overwhelm the person wearing it (I.e. she’s wearing the dress; the dress isn’t wearing her)

How do stylish women put together outfits that don’t take over? I’ve seen advice about confidence, taking off one accessory, using color seasons, using kibbe. Is that it? Do any of you have this problem?

Do any of you have any thoughts/advice? ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hn0vrp/wearing_the_clothes_vs_the_clothes_wearing_you/,hot,"I wear a lot of stuff that could be described as ""loud"" and ""out there"". Confidence is a pretty big part of wearing bold stuff and being comfortable in your own skin makes a huge difference. It also takes a degree of emotional energy to handle the extra attention. No, no one's going to assail, spit on you, and call you a harlot causing a need for you to steel yourself before stepping out of the house. There are just days you don't feel like being *that person* and being uncomfortable with it shows. 

Another idea of something ""wearing you"" is that the item is too much or doesn't fit the wearer in the context of the vibe or intention. So if your hair, your makeup, the rest of your outfit says 2010s beige minimalism, high shine PVC spiked goth club platform boots are probably going to be incongruous in a way that stands out negatively.
Making something look cohesive or intentional will serve to make bold items look more natural. | Depending on how balls to the wall you wanna go, it's picking what's going to be the highlight and styling the outfit around it.

Having bridging colours so things feel intentional - like if you want to go for an all red outfit, it's generally smarter and less eye watering to do 1-2 items be a true red, and the rest of the outfit be red adjacent - so burgundies or pinks,  depending on the colour palette you're working with.

Another thing is you have to nail the style and fit before you dial up the colour or prints.   Stuff has to fit right and sit on you nicely before YOU wear the outfit.  If it's ill fitting - too big or too small or badly tailored, the outfit is going to wear you.

And also it has to be something you LOVE.  If you're not into space and try and wear a galaxy themed outfit, it's just not going to sit as well because you're not loving it. | tbh I think this problem is overblown at best, made up at worst, and almost exclusively applied to women.

The only times I've ever personally felt like ""the clothes were wearing somebody"" was when it was overtly apparent that the clothes were outside of their comfort zone, either aesthetically, contextually, or outright literally (i.e. teetering in high heels they aren't used to, tugging at something that keeps riding up, etc.). 

But the best way to build confidence and get used to wearing clothes outside of one's comfort zone is to wear them out of the house, so it's sort of a catch-22.",

I’m in college and recently realized that I have outgrown the style of most of my clothes. I am wanting to get some pieces that feel more grown up but still fun. I mostly wear neutrals and jewel tones in simple patterns, prioritizing 100% natural fibers. My biggest issue has been finding tops that I like.

Does anyone have brands or silhouette recommendations? | I am on a weight loss journey. I have lost 148 pounds so far, I plan to lose about 50 more. I've gone from a 4x to XL. My current measurements are 44"" bust, 35"" waist, 49.5"" hips (very pear shaped) and I am 5'5"". 

Obviously, the wardrobe shifts have been pretty drastic. But also slow going. I've been shopping at the brands I had to shop at when I was bigger (Torrid, etc.). But they're limited and too pricey for the quality. For the first time, I have options, but I don't know brands.

I almost exclusively wear dresses, I usually like them to be mini to tea length (I feel like any longer excentuates my wide hips). I like florals, colors, and really feminine silhouettes. I like more defined waists on my dresses, so I usually lean towards fit and flare. My go-to outfit is black leggings/tights, a dress with some sort of print/design, and a neutral cardigan. Jess from New Girl basically has my ideal closet.

Also, I have a public facing boring government job. I need new work clothes, so I am looking for more professional brands too.

It’s a nice enough coat and I am truly grateful for the gift. It was extremely thoughtful of them to notice that I’ve wanted a wool coat for ages. And the coat does have nice closures and a practical collar that can be buttoned closed for cold weather. However, the problem is that the coat fits like an oversized potato sack on me and is very loose, shapeless and unstructured. The sleeves also cover my hands and I’m practically tripping over the hem.


As a result, I’m going to take it to a tailor to see if I can salvage it. But before I spend the money, would it be possible to also install some feminine flair into this thing while I’m at it? I’m thinking of trying to shift the design to be closer to the old school [princess coats](https://imgur.com/a/Uo6othS) I’ve always wanted to own with some pleating at the skirt, a nipped in waist (created by real tailoring, not a tie waist with an ugly bathrobe belt) and an overall polished fit n flare look. If it is possible to ask a tailor or seamstress revamp this coat into a true princess coat, then what would be a good ballpark estimate for the cost of that? 


If it’s not possible, then where would I find a fully lined, black, New England winter suitable and 79-100% wool princess cut coat in a similar price range to the madewell coat?",

How do you do baggy in the right way?,"I see some people wear a baggy t-shirt over slacks or jeans and it can look so good, same thing with big knit sweaters or a men's button down. It looks so artsy and nonchalant.

Other times it can look a bit awkward or just not stylish. What's the ""right"" way to wear baggy clothes?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hjis48/how_do_you_do_baggy_in_the_right_way/,hot,"I think it comes down to proportions. Both your body and the garments. Understanding if you have long/short/balanced torso and legs can be a helpful starting point. Then look at the proportions of the garment: some oversized tshirts emphasize the arm width and length, others are cut to have more length in the body or width. Depending on what you’re pairing it with it will change the visual “weight” of the outfit and emphasize different features. Some people use the rule of “big top, little bottoms” or “little top, big bottoms” to achieve balance but it doesn’t always work well (for me). Tucking, rolling sleeves, material composition and drape, and undergarments also make a big difference. (Sorry not a straightforward answer 😅) | This answer is not super helpful but I think it depends a lot on context. When I go to hip hop class and everyone is wearing baggy-on-baggy streetwear, I feel so natural wearing all baggy too and I feel really wrong and self-conscious wearing something tight fitting. Vs if I go to another thing where everyone is wearing leggings or mini skirts, and I wear baggy cargo pants and hoodie, I look silly and like I didn’t make an effort. | Like already stated knowing what works on your proportions are the first part- I’m 5’2” with a short waist, no boobs, and a very straight build (like a brick, lol), and I love love love oversized. Just can’t be wearing the same stuff as a willowy 5’8” person. 

But also fabric choice is huge. Many button downs are too stiff and look like a sloppy trapeze if they are worn oversize ( but again, probably fine on tall and thin), whereas a finer fabric with more drape would work better. Same for pants too, fabric with more movement that hangs better can look great. When I’m wearing big knits, I always make sure my pants are more drapey or stick with flares to kinda balance out the oversize top so I don’t look like Im trying to walk on tiny toothpick legs

"Do you think things still go ""out of fashion""?","Let me explain. Outfits can be unfashionable.

I bought some Bombas on poshmark for a very good price. I looked up the model online, the composition was mostly cotton, and everything looked good. I didn’t realize i hadnt seen a pic of the material composition of the socks i was buying, honestly i feel the seller intentionally left out this information because otherwise the photos were good! 

So I bought them and had them sent to my mom’s for a christmas gift, she sent me pics, i accepted the order. 

Now i get here and am wrapping the socks and I notice the material composition is NOT cotton! It’s 97% polyester. I was like ??? And then i saw it says “for donation purposes only”!! 

So!! Bombas donations are of inferior quality than the items they sell. I looked on their website and could not find any socks that were 97% polyester. They don’t sell this version of their product.

It was found 3 weeks later on a nearby balcony, some unknown jackass moved it there for whatever reason (I assumed they were going to come back to steal it, and never made it)

Two weeks ago a Jcrew delivery and an ASOS delivery showed up at the same time, the ASOS package got jacked but the Jcrew one was left. Fortunately the Jcrew box had the expensive, sold out item. | Inspired by YouTube I just made a Pinterest board called I Didn’t Do It.

So far I’ve just been tracking what I wear to work or out with friends, and have skipped logging the lounge clothes I wear for work from home days/weekends, the random t-shirt and jeans I throw on to run errands, or clothes I wear to the gym, and I also haven’t added belts, jewelry or other accessories to the app. 

This has been working ok for me but I can’t help feel I’m missing out on some opportunity to better understand the items that I enjoy the most (so I can get more things in a similar vein) and those that really just sit untouched. I would love to hear from others who use Whering and similar apps about how you take that information to shape your wardrobe! ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hfpm1k/for_the_people_who_use_wardrobe_tracking_apps_how/,hot,"I don’t know how it compares, but here are some fun ways I use Stylebook:

- Using the outfit tab, I start with any clothing item (skirt, top, whatever). I then make as many different outfits as I can with that item. When I feel like I can’t come up with anything else, I move on to another item and repeat. If an item hardly goes with anything else in my closet, I may consider donating it. 

- Using the random outfit generator, I play around till something sparks an idea. Rarely will the generator come up with a whole outfit that works, but seeing, for example, this skirt with that jacket that I never thought about pairing will get me started. 

- I go through a category of clothing and arrange items according to how long it’s been since I’ve worn them. Like my long-sleeved dresses now have the recently worn items at the bottom so I see the stuff that’s been collecting dust at the top of the page and am more tempted to wear those items. 

- I go through entire categories after a season has passed and see what I never got around to wearing. I’ll consider if there was a valid reason (formal dress with no formal events that season will get a pass; one sundress unworn when I wore other sundresses repeatedly, no pass) and donate items I clearly made no effort to wear. 

- When shopping, I open the app and see what all I can match up with an item I’m considering buying. Helps me avoid purchases I’ll never wear. 

- I look through my most worn items for themes. I tend to get the most use out of purses, jackets, and boots in bright colors. This guides me when I’m considering spending a little more on something that fits one of those categories.

- I look through my cost per wear list and assess where my mistakes are happening. Some items are worth extra money and some rarely are. This often coincides with most/least worn items but not always. A super cheap item is still a bit useless if I only use it once, and an expensive item that I won’t use often is also better to avoid. 

- There’s a notes section on each item & I use it to type in words like “thrifted” or “new” so I can search those terms and see if I’m maintaining my preference for a mostly thrifted wardrobe. I also type in the purchase date of an item so I have some frame of reference if an item is on my rarely worn list. Seeing you’ve owned something for 5 years and worn it once hits different than misremembering you bought it 2 years ago. | I’ve been wondering this myself as well! I use Stylebook and I mostly use it for knowing what items I wear most, when the last time I wore something was, but honestly the packing feature is my absolute favorite.

It’s also very enlightening to see what gets worn the least, and I now know to cull these items for my ongoing purge. It’s hard to argue with worn history facts!

What I do not inventory & track:
- Earrings
- Activewear (including workout-only shoes)
- Pajamas / at home only loungewear
- Socks, bras, underwear, hosiery
- Gloves, hats and other seasonal accessories I rarely wear
- Swimwear

I go back and forth on whether it’d be helpful to start inventorying/tracking activewear, though. I have so much, and work out often enough that I’d get something out of it, but I don’t want to burden my daily life by having to log everything. Definitely curious to hear what others are doing! | I've been using cataloguing my wardrobe as motivation to also do the wardrobe purge/reorganization I've been meaning to do for like a year. I just completely emptied out my entire dresser and I've logged almost all of it, even the stuff that I hardly ever wear. For the things that I was already kind of on the fence about, if I couldn't even bring myself to take a picture of them, that was a pretty clear final sign that I could let it go. My drawers are already SO MUCH ROOMIER y'all. 

But I only started about a month ago; have a feeling that, after a year or so, I'll have a much easier time letting go of those edge cases that I kept but already kinda know I shouldn't have. And I'm also hoping it will help me discover new possibilities for older pieces that I haven't been wearing but still feel like I need—who knows? Maybe they'll be my new-old staples.

It also helps that I'm really good at remembering facts about my clothing. I remember where and when I bought things and approximately how much I paid back through about 2018 or so—couldn't tell you why, but it's useful. Maybe because that's when I started selling seriously on Poshmark, which completely upended my relationship with shopping? That Poshmark experience also helps in that I'm really comfy with photographing/editing clothing AND/OR quickly finding stock photos for stuff I know that I own. I've definitely used stock photos for things I've bought recently because I knew I could find them through my email receipts or Shop app aaaand that's easier than dragging the thing out and actually taking a decent picture. But taking one picture is so much easier than taking a bunch that are good enough to post something for sale, so it still feels weirdly easy to me.

Aaaaand also now I'm kinda hooked on the analytics, so I've been logging everything, more or less. Workout outfit that I changed into in the middle of the work day? YES. Lazy WFH athleisure outfit that I intended to go to yoga in later and then flaked on? (Cough today cough) Still logged it, because I like these pieces and I want them to get credit. Is that weird? Yes. ***But the analytics.***

ETA: part of what's keeping me motivated is that I'm using Indyx and I intend to use their stylist feature once I have everything logged. I think having fresh eyes on my wardrobe will be really interesting and will help with that whole goal of re-integrating pieces that have potential but I haven't figured out how to wear.",

Does anyone agree / have any stories to share? | I thrifted a dress from a brand I've never heard of, so I googled them.

I just put on headphones and enjoy sifting through the racks, some days I could do it for hours, but I know it's not for everyone. My advice is to visit your local thrift store frequently, check the new arrivals and clearance section first, and be OK with leaving empty-handed. I shop by feel, ignore 99% of the polyester and check tags for fibre content. 

If you hate thrifting just go to Depop/FB Marketplace/Poshmark; that said, you need to know what brands to search for, and I discovered most of my favourite brands by thrifting first, so I think some experience with thrifting is helpful before shopping for secondhand clothes online. | As a millennial it somewhat warms my heart to see so many saying eBay.",

I’d love if I could get some input on a couple of dress options. I’m torn between these two dresses.

I’ll use Asket as an example since they list the actual prices for raw materials, manufacturing, and markup. This is a merino wool turtleneck that’s $115, which is pretty typical for brands in this tier.

I realize a cheaper and sustainable alternative is to just buy secondhand, but in this case I’m talking about buying new, which is what people commonly do.

I've noticed I gravitate strongly to black and white outfits, clean cuts, skirts/dresses, heels. But every time I try on an outfit like that I feel so stupid.

Much love to this community y'all are so sweet 🧡🧡",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hcmovg/what_if_your_style_doesnt_match_your_lifestyle/,hot,"A month or two ago I realized I was playing it safe clothing wise.  I am 51 and decided what am I waiting for, I’m going to have some fun and who cares. I bought myself some cool adidas gazelles I had been eyeing, some bright colored sweaters, and jeans. I feel more like me than I have in years. Some of the outfits I’ve put together are out of my comfort zone-a blazer with a bright shirt, jeans, flats and a statement necklace. Totally not my usual style but it has challenged me to have confidence. All this to say, I think clothes are a great place to have fun and express one’s self. At the same time stay true to yourself. Kind of a place where the two meet. | I've grappled with this for a fair bit. When I was younger, I lived in the city, worked in a museum, and generally had a really unique style. I took a lot of risks, bought really interesting pieces, and was proud to be known as a fashionable, stylish person. I also had more of a ""going out"" lifestyle where I was able to really push the envelope with my outfits. Fast forward to now and my work is either done at home or in the field in rural or otherwise less developed areas. I don't do as much going out (due to my travel schedule and my friend network being much more scattered these days) and so my wardrobe has really shifted to more athletic, travel-type clothes that can pack down into a tiny bag and be washed in a sink.

In my heart though, I'm still that girl who loves putting together unique outfits and I really miss her. It took a slightly tipsy post happy hour mild meltdown in a Zara where I told my friend that I was so sad because ""I miss dressing pretty and all I wear are UGLY ADVENTURE CLOTHES"" to help me re-orient things and try to incorporate my need to be styled into my lifestyle of trekking around in the jungle. I leaned into neutral color palettes with unique pieces of jewelry, hats, or scarves to give my look some character. I mix in natural fibers like cotton, linen, and wool with my quick dry athletic wear, which is both super functional and helps me feel put together. When I'm at home, I make it a point to look stylish and put together just about any time I'm leaving the house - I wear all those niece outfits even just to grab a beer with friends. It's my way to trying to have my balance and even if I'm not quite as envelope pushing as I used to be, I feel like I'm still giving my inner fashion girlie the chance to flex. | I'm a 50 year old boring housewife who hardly ever has a reason to dress up but I dress nice every day anyway because I love doing it, it makes me feel good when I look pulled together. You should dress in a way that makes YOU feel good.",

How do I store my ""wardrobe"" of eyeglasses?

Between relatively recent ""disruptions"" in optical market making cute glasses more affordable and a personal struggle to keep up with my things, I now have a wardrobe(?) of 12-15 pairs of progressive readers in regular rotation. I am usually missing 3-4 pairs at any given time (gym bag? coat pocket? car console? hastily switched purse? Gone Forever?). I'm here seeking ideas/hacks for safe storage that might work well for an out-of-sight, out-of-mind type like myself.

Full disclosure: This is a First World Problem, yes. To my mind, I am less likely to buy additional pairs at whatever price if I can keep up with (not lose) what I have. Best ways for me to keep up with what I have are to (i) quit taking my glasses on/off during the day and (ii) develop muscle memory around a storage routine that reminds me which glasses are (probably) where. *I am too vain to do the neck chain dangle thing like my mom ... sorrynotsorry.* Thanks for any help with *storage* tips LOL. | Thoughts on whether a velvet dress would be strictly a holiday dress or something I could wear other times of year. I’ve been eyeing a velvet mini dress, but I want it to be versatile enough that I can wear it throughout the year, not just around the holidays. This dress specifically. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!
