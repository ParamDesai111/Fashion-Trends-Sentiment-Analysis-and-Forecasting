I’m looking into a Max Mara coat (weekend max mara wool and alpaca coat). Does anyone know if the recommendation is to size up?

I was looking for a new winter wool coat and it has come down to these two picks.  
I am 180 cm in length and both are of similar quality (2 just has a little kashmir in it)

However I am unsure about the length. I read various opinions online about coat lengths: above the knee or below it and I am unsure which works better.  
I feel that with 2 any dresses or midi skirts will stick out from under it too much and I guess for the price I would prefer something a bit more perfect where I don't feel like my coat is out of place.  
  
Personally I am leaning towards the first, somehow it feels 2 is too short for my length and figure, but I would like some opinions.

Wearing the clothes vs the clothes wearing you,"Hi guys! 

What are your thoughts on styling outfits that don’t overwhelm the person wearing it (I.e. she’s wearing the dress; the dress isn’t wearing her)

How do stylish women put together outfits that don’t take over? I’ve seen advice about confidence, taking off one accessory, using color seasons, using kibbe. Is that it? Do any of you have this problem?

Do any of you have any thoughts/advice? ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hn0vrp/wearing_the_clothes_vs_the_clothes_wearing_you/,hot,"I wear a lot of stuff that could be described as ""loud"" and ""out there"". Confidence is a pretty big part of wearing bold stuff and being comfortable in your own skin makes a huge difference. It also takes a degree of emotional energy to handle the extra attention. No, no one's going to assail, spit on you, and call you a harlot causing a need for you to steel yourself before stepping out of the house. There are just days you don't feel like being *that person* and being uncomfortable with it shows. 

Another idea of something ""wearing you"" is that the item is too much or doesn't fit the wearer in the context of the vibe or intention. So if your hair, your makeup, the rest of your outfit says 2010s beige minimalism, high shine PVC spiked goth club platform boots are probably going to be incongruous in a way that stands out negatively.
Making something look cohesive or intentional will serve to make bold items look more natural. | Depending on how balls to the wall you wanna go, it's picking what's going to be the highlight and styling the outfit around it.

Having bridging colours so things feel intentional - like if you want to go for an all red outfit, it's generally smarter and less eye watering to do 1-2 items be a true red, and the rest of the outfit be red adjacent - so burgundies or pinks,  depending on the colour palette you're working with.

Another thing is you have to nail the style and fit before you dial up the colour or prints.   Stuff has to fit right and sit on you nicely before YOU wear the outfit.  If it's ill fitting - too big or too small or badly tailored, the outfit is going to wear you.

And also it has to be something you LOVE.  If you're not into space and try and wear a galaxy themed outfit, it's just not going to sit as well because you're not loving it. | tbh I think this problem is overblown at best, made up at worst, and almost exclusively applied to women.

The only times I've ever personally felt like ""the clothes were wearing somebody"" was when it was overtly apparent that the clothes were outside of their comfort zone, either aesthetically, contextually, or outright literally (i.e. teetering in high heels they aren't used to, tugging at something that keeps riding up, etc.). 

But the best way to build confidence and get used to wearing clothes outside of one's comfort zone is to wear them out of the house, so it's sort of a catch-22.",

I’m in college and recently realized that I have outgrown the style of most of my clothes. I am wanting to get some pieces that feel more grown up but still fun. I mostly wear neutrals and jewel tones in simple patterns, prioritizing 100% natural fibers. My biggest issue has been finding tops that I like. I mostly wear graphic tees, but would love to find options that are slightly more elevated than that. I still am in college, so something that is still casual is preferred. Does anyone have brands or silhouette recommendations? | I am on a weight loss journey. I have lost 148 pounds so far, I plan to lose about 50 more. I've gone from a 4x to XL. My current measurements are 44"" bust, 35"" waist, 49.5"" hips (very pear shaped) and I am 5'5"". 

Obviously, the wardrobe shifts have been pretty drastic. But also slow going. I've been shopping at the brands I had to shop at when I was bigger (Torrid, etc.). But they're limited and too pricey for the quality. For the first time, I have options, but I don't know brands.

I almost exclusively wear dresses, I usually like them to be mini to tea length (I feel like any longer excentuates my wide hips). I like florals, colors, and really feminine silhouettes. I like more defined waists on my dresses, so I usually lean towards fit and flare. My go-to outfit is black leggings/tights, a dress with some sort of print/design, and a neutral cardigan. Jess from New Girl basically has my ideal closet.

Also, I have a public facing boring government job. I need new work clothes, so I am looking for more professional brands too. I don't want anything low quality, but I don't want to spend a ton on transitionary clothes either.

It’s a nice enough coat and I am truly grateful for the gift. It was extremely thoughtful of them to notice that I’ve wanted a wool coat for ages.

However, the problem is that the coat fits like an oversized potato sack on me and is very loose, shapeless and unstructured. The sleeves also cover my hands and I’m practically tripping over the hem.


As a result, I’m going to take it to a tailor to see if I can salvage it. But before I spend the money, would it be possible to also install some feminine flair into this thing while I’m at it?

I have recently had a big life change and I’m in need of both basic and statement jewelry. Gold looks better on me than silver. I prefer some basic pieces but also flamboyant alt/indie pieces, like Little Rooms (Google tells me the gold wears off so they are not an option.)

I am confused on how to identify quality jewelry at a more affordable price point. For example, I found an alt brand called Bonearrow that has 6ct gold, but Google tells me I need 12 to 14 for it not to wear off? 

I am looking for quality brands that work in gold at an affordable price point and information about what words I need to Google to determine if something is quality or not. For example, if something that looks like gold exists, but isn’t gold I would also be open to that, but I don’t know if that’s a thing.

How do you do baggy in the right way?,"I see some people wear a baggy t-shirt over slacks or jeans and it can look so good, same thing with big knit sweaters or a men's button down. It looks so artsy and nonchalant.

Other times it can look a bit awkward or just not stylish. What's the ""right"" way to wear baggy clothes?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hjis48/how_do_you_do_baggy_in_the_right_way/,hot,"I think it comes down to proportions. Both your body and the garments. Understanding if you have long/short/balanced torso and legs can be a helpful starting point. Then look at the proportions of the garment: some oversized tshirts emphasize the arm width and length, others are cut to have more length in the body or width. Depending on what you’re pairing it with it will change the visual “weight” of the outfit and emphasize different features. Some people use the rule of “big top, little bottoms” or “little top, big bottoms” to achieve balance but it doesn’t always work well (for me). Tucking, rolling sleeves, material composition and drape, and undergarments also make a big difference. (Sorry not a straightforward answer 😅) | This answer is not super helpful but I think it depends a lot on context. When I go to hip hop class and everyone is wearing baggy-on-baggy streetwear, I feel so natural wearing all baggy too and I feel really wrong and self-conscious wearing something tight fitting. Vs if I go to another thing where everyone is wearing leggings or mini skirts, and I wear baggy cargo pants and hoodie, I look silly and like I didn’t make an effort. | Like already stated knowing what works on your proportions are the first part- I’m 5’2” with a short waist, no boobs, and a very straight build (like a brick, lol), and I love love love oversized. Just can’t be wearing the same stuff as a willowy 5’8” person. 

But also fabric choice is huge. Many button downs are too stiff and look like a sloppy trapeze if they are worn oversize ( but again, probably fine on tall and thin), whereas a finer fabric with more drape would work better. Same for pants too, fabric with more movement that hangs better can look great. When I’m wearing big knits, I always make sure my pants are more drapey or stick with flares to kinda balance out the oversize top so I don’t look like Im trying to walk on tiny toothpick legs 

Plus, accessories are always helpful",
