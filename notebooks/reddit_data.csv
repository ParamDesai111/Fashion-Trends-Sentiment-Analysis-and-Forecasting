I've held my tongue as long as I can.,"Some of the questions that get asked here are so trivial or strange that I find myself, on a daily basis, questioning whether actual human beings are asking them.

I've chosen to make a standalone post that doesn't reference any specific posts rather than commenting on one of these posts because I don't want to hurt someones feelings by falsely singling them out if I'm wrong.

I'm just going to trust that many of you will know the kind of posts I'm talking about, and possibly feel.the same way I do about them. No one needs to know what post was the straw that broke the camels back.

Sometimes I find myself wondering if brands are marketing themselves by having their social media people ask stupid questions in fashion forums as a pretext for mentioning the brand they represent.

Sometimes I find myself wondering if AI modelers had the chat bot (there is no intelligence to an AI, it's always just a chat bot) come up with a question for them to post on Reddit and see if it passes for human.

Fashion in the boonies,"Admittedly, I'm newer to being interested in men's fashion - always had a taste for it, but never had the headroom or wallet capacity to make anything work. 

After reading through a few posts here and a bit of the wiki, I have a question - what would y'all do for fashion in the middle of nowhere?

For some context, the town I live in has a population of around 3,800 and two(!) stoplights. The nearest city where I do any and all shopping for anything fashionable is just under an hour away, and the nearest with any cultural significance (IE that you've actually heard of) is 2-1/2 to 3 hours away. 

I work in a steel shop so my normal day-to-day is hard wearing jeans, steel toed boots, and a company t shirt, since I don't mind if I get those dirty and it won't end up with a dry cleaning bill.

I've picked up some pieces from Dillard's clearance and the assorted outlet stores, TJ Maxx, Marshalls, that sort of thing. Several sets of shorts, khakis, nicer jeans, some polos, button ups, a couple quarter zips, a bit of knitwear. Even two sets of linen pants which I adore. A pair of Madden lace up boots, two pair of (dreaded?) dress sneakers, and a pair of lace up derby shoes. Frankly I'm terrified to wear most of it unless I'm headed out of town to a more urban area, or I'm confident I'll be staying indoors most of the time. Cleaning dog mess off of nice boots is an experience I'd not like to repeat.

So how would y'all address it? Wear it, cleaning be damned? Difference of opinion on shoes and bottoms? Move (only semi joking)? Thoughts, opinions? ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1hgjypk/fashion_in_the_boonies/,hot,"If you dress differently from those around you, you will get (harmless) comments from others. But you‚Äôll also gain confidence and stop caring. | I‚Äôd lean into elevated workwear styles. Carhart jackets, red wing boots, selvedge denim, heavy duty knitwear, etc.

These clothes be more durable than your average mall brands, and you won‚Äôt stand out too much like you would by wearing tailoring in a small town. | Try to avoid stepping in dog crap. Also maybe get some cowboy boots for when you‚Äôre going to be doing something that would make it difficult to keep your nice shoes clean."

**(edit: posted a pic of the suit I‚Äôm looking at in the comments)**",,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1hgfrp6/has_anyone_tried_he_spoke_style_suits/,hot,"I don‚Äôt have any experience with that brand, but I just wanted to say you probably shouldn‚Äôt discount SuitSupply quite yet. You‚Äôre doing MTM anyway, which SuitSupply also offers, and their MTM offerings work just fine for people who don‚Äôt fit their standard options. I‚Äôm far from slim myself and basically nothing off the rack from them works for me, but their MTM is fine. They have two main advantages here - one, depending on where you live you could go get measured in-store, and two, all their MTM offerings are fully (and easily) returnable just like an off the rack suit would be. If it doesn‚Äôt work for you you can just ship it back and get a full refund (obviously remakes are also an option, as with most MTM offerings, but the ability to just decide you don‚Äôt like it at all and get a refund is really nice).

The other thing to consider is that you might be better off going to places where you can try the suits on in person, vs going fully MTM. In particular if you can find a store that offers separates. With an athletic build your problem is likely not that the off the rack suits don‚Äôt work from you (you aren‚Äôt going to have really wacky proportions like a wide belly that forces you into way too broad shoulders) - more so that off the rack suits will not have enough drop for you (I.e. you can get the right size pants or the right size jacket but not both). Separates solve that. Look for a fuller cut (because of the aforementioned thick thighs), which shouldn‚Äôt be too hard as that style is what is back in right now, but otherwise you shouldn‚Äôt have too much trouble finding something that can then be altered to fit. And you‚Äôll have a much easier time of getting the best possible fit than you would with MTM. I think MTM is mostly best for people with extreme proportions which force them into only bad options (only way to get a jacket that fits around the middle is to get shoulders/chest several sizes too large which can‚Äôt be fixed, etc). | Check out the suit supply ‚ÄúRoma‚Äù fit.
