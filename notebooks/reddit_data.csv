Vibe shift: heading towards the end of quiet luxury?!,"It seems like Who What Wear is predicting a vibe shift away from quiet luxury and towards maximalism, personalized style, and boho for spring / summer: [article](https://www.whowhatwear.com/fashion/trends/state-of-style-2024).

How do you feel about the shift?

If you are planning to incorporate any of the more maximal style trends, how are you planning to work them in?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hp6lu1/vibe_shift_heading_towards_the_end_of_quiet_luxury/,hot,"Depends on what you consider rich I guess. 


The richest people in the world haven't changed nor are likely to change their clothing styles. Wealthy actresses are still wearing basically gym/lounge clothes in their day to day lives. The moderately wealthy are still enamored with country club and tech still wears outdoor gear.


So I don't know who these people embracing maximalism are other than the fashion houses themselves hoping people will buy more shit if they announce trends are changing and terminally online influencers who are trying to get more clicks.


The article is kinda funny -- quiet luxury is out and a bunch of innocuous expensive coats and tshirts are back in. That's... quiet luxury. | You’re always going to have people wearing “quiet luxury” because that’s just their personal style, but happy to see more colorful, eclectic style celebrated too...although I agree with another commenter here that they kinda just rebranded quiet luxury in this article. 

If I’m leaning into any of their trend predictions, it’s individualism. But not necessarily in the bag charm way. For me, “personalization” means carefully curating items from the resale market that align with my personal style/lifestyle. I’ve been collecting avant-garde styles from Junya Watanabe, Rei Kawakubo, Margiela, etc. that don’t necessarily conform to trends—and even when they do, they’re things that align with my personal style, like oversized tailoring. Because I’m buying them years after they first appeared, fewer people are wearing them (and I’m getting a nice discount). And because they have unexpected design elements, it’s difficult to place them in any era….so they are timeless in their own way. So I’ll continue doing that in the 2025 and beyond. | That would tie in with my hypothesis that recession pop is coming back. But I'm not a scientist",

CCW! These are all outfits I've worn to campus in the past couple of weeks. I've added an accessory and a jacket since my last post!

Specifically, are the black jeans (top left, bottom left) too short to wear with these boots? Hard to see, but my socks are visible between the hem and top of the boot. Also, I would take any sweater-tucking advice--I don't love tucking sweaters all the way around so often go for a French tuck, but then have a bit of a ducktail at the back (middle right) that can look a little funny!

Wearing the clothes vs the clothes wearing you,"Hi guys! 

What are your thoughts on styling outfits that don’t overwhelm the person wearing it (I.e. she’s wearing the dress; the dress isn’t wearing her)

How do stylish women put together outfits that don’t take over? I’ve seen advice about confidence, taking off one accessory, using color seasons, using kibbe. Is that it? Do any of you have this problem?

Do any of you have any thoughts/advice? ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hn0vrp/wearing_the_clothes_vs_the_clothes_wearing_you/,hot,"I wear a lot of stuff that could be described as ""loud"" and ""out there"". Confidence is a pretty big part of wearing bold stuff and being comfortable in your own skin makes a huge difference. It also takes a degree of emotional energy to handle the extra attention. No, no one's going to assail, spit on you, and call you a harlot causing a need for you to steel yourself before stepping out of the house. There are just days you don't feel like being *that person* and being uncomfortable with it shows. 

Another idea of something ""wearing you"" is that the item is too much or doesn't fit the wearer in the context of the vibe or intention. So if your hair, your makeup, the rest of your outfit says 2010s beige minimalism, high shine PVC spiked goth club platform boots are probably going to be incongruous in a way that stands out negatively.
Making something look cohesive or intentional will serve to make bold items look more natural. | Depending on how balls to the wall you wanna go, it's picking what's going to be the highlight and styling the outfit around it.

Having bridging colours so things feel intentional - like if you want to go for an all red outfit, it's generally smarter and less eye watering to do 1-2 items be a true red, and the rest of the outfit be red adjacent - so burgundies or pinks,  depending on the colour palette you're working with.

Another thing is you have to nail the style and fit before you dial up the colour or prints.   Stuff has to fit right and sit on you nicely before YOU wear the outfit.  If it's ill fitting - too big or too small or badly tailored, the outfit is going to wear you.

And also it has to be something you LOVE.  If you're not into space and try and wear a galaxy themed outfit, it's just not going to sit as well because you're not loving it. | tbh I think this problem is overblown at best, made up at worst, and almost exclusively applied to women.

The only times I've ever personally felt like ""the clothes were wearing somebody"" was when it was overtly apparent that the clothes were outside of their comfort zone, either aesthetically, contextually, or outright literally (i.e. teetering in high heels they aren't used to, tugging at something that keeps riding up, etc.). 

But the best way to build confidence and get used to wearing clothes outside of one's comfort zone is to wear them out of the house, so it's sort of a catch-22.",

I’m in college and recently realized that I have outgrown the style of most of my clothes. I am wanting to get some pieces that feel more grown up but still fun. I mostly wear neutrals and jewel tones in simple patterns, prioritizing 100% natural fibers. My biggest issue has been finding tops that I like.

Does anyone have brands or silhouette recommendations? | I am on a weight loss journey. I have lost 148 pounds so far, I plan to lose about 50 more. I've gone from a 4x to XL. My current measurements are 44"" bust, 35"" waist, 49.5"" hips (very pear shaped) and I am 5'5"". 

Obviously, the wardrobe shifts have been pretty drastic. But also slow going. I've been shopping at the brands I had to shop at when I was bigger (Torrid, etc.). But they're limited and too pricey for the quality. For the first time, I have options, but I don't know brands.

I almost exclusively wear dresses, I usually like them to be mini to tea length (I feel like any longer excentuates my wide hips). I like florals, colors, and really feminine silhouettes. I like more defined waists on my dresses, so I usually lean towards fit and flare. My go-to outfit is black leggings/tights, a dress with some sort of print/design, and a neutral cardigan.

Also, I have a public facing boring government job. I need new work clothes, so I am looking for more professional brands too.

It’s a nice enough coat and I am truly grateful for the gift. It was extremely thoughtful of them to notice that I’ve wanted a wool coat for ages. And the coat does have nice closures and a practical collar that can be buttoned closed for cold weather. However, the problem is that the coat fits like an oversized potato sack on me and is very loose, shapeless and unstructured. The sleeves also cover my hands and I’m practically tripping over the hem.


As a result, I’m going to take it to a tailor to see if I can salvage it. But before I spend the money, would it be possible to also install some feminine flair into this thing while I’m at it? I’m thinking of trying to shift the design to be closer to the old school [princess coats](https://imgur.com/a/Uo6othS) I’ve always wanted to own with some pleating at the skirt, a nipped in waist (created by real tailoring, not a tie waist with an ugly bathrobe belt) and an overall polished fit n flare look. If it is possible to ask a tailor or seamstress revamp this coat into a true princess coat, then what would be a good ballpark estimate for the cost of that? 


If it’s not possible, then where would I find a fully lined, black, New England winter suitable and 79-100% wool princess cut coat in a similar price range to the madewell coat?",

How do you do baggy in the right way?,"I see some people wear a baggy t-shirt over slacks or jeans and it can look so good, same thing with big knit sweaters or a men's button down. It looks so artsy and nonchalant.

Other times it can look a bit awkward or just not stylish.

Both your body and the garments. Understanding if you have long/short/balanced torso and legs can be a helpful starting point. Then look at the proportions of the garment: some oversized tshirts emphasize the arm width and length, others are cut to have more length in the body or width. Depending on what you’re pairing it with it will change the visual “weight” of the outfit and emphasize different features. Some people use the rule of “big top, little bottoms” or “little top, big bottoms” to achieve balance but it doesn’t always work well (for me). Tucking, rolling sleeves, material composition and drape, and undergarments also make a big difference. (Sorry not a straightforward answer 😅) | This answer is not super helpful but I think it depends a lot on context. When I go to hip hop class and everyone is wearing baggy-on-baggy streetwear, I feel so natural wearing all baggy too and I feel really wrong and self-conscious wearing something tight fitting. Vs if I go to another thing where everyone is wearing leggings or mini skirts, and I wear baggy cargo pants and hoodie, I look silly and like I didn’t make an effort. | Like already stated knowing what works on your proportions are the first part- I’m 5’2” with a short waist, no boobs, and a very straight build (like a brick, lol), and I love love love oversized.

Many button downs are too stiff and look like a sloppy trapeze if they are worn oversize ( but again, probably fine on tall and thin), whereas a finer fabric with more drape would work better. Same for pants too, fabric with more movement that hangs better can look great. When I’m wearing big knits, I always make sure my pants are more drapey or stick with flares to kinda balance out the oversize top so I don’t look like Im trying to walk on tiny toothpick legs

What was the last fashion related compliment you gave? | How do you add holiday sparkle, shine, shimmer?  Velvet, sequins, rhinestones, satin?

Every other aspects of the fit will feel good—waist fits, there feels like there should be enough fabric because nothing feels tight (but it’s obvious that there’s not enough fabric - for context I have a relatively large butt and a relatively small waist for someone my size).

"For the people who use wardrobe tracking apps, how do you make the most of it? ","I started using Whering recently to see what in my wardrobe is getting the most use and help figure out what to invest in so I can get dressed and actually feel good about my options. So far I’ve just been tracking what I wear to work or out with friends, and have skipped logging the lounge clothes I wear for work from home days/weekends, the random t-shirt and jeans I throw on to run errands, or clothes I wear to the gym, and I also haven’t added belts, jewelry or other accessories to the app. 

This has been working ok for me but I can’t help feel I’m missing out on some opportunity to better understand the items that I enjoy the most (so I can get more things in a similar vein) and those that really just sit untouched. I would love to hear from others who use Whering and similar apps about how you take that information to shape your wardrobe! ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hfpm1k/for_the_people_who_use_wardrobe_tracking_apps_how/,hot,"I don’t know how it compares, but here are some fun ways I use Stylebook:

- Using the outfit tab, I start with any clothing item (skirt, top, whatever). I then make as many different outfits as I can with that item. When I feel like I can’t come up with anything else, I move on to another item and repeat. If an item hardly goes with anything else in my closet, I may consider donating it. 

- Using the random outfit generator, I play around till something sparks an idea. Rarely will the generator come up with a whole outfit that works, but seeing, for example, this skirt with that jacket that I never thought about pairing will get me started. 

- I go through a category of clothing and arrange items according to how long it’s been since I’ve worn them. Like my long-sleeved dresses now have the recently worn items at the bottom so I see the stuff that’s been collecting dust at the top of the page and am more tempted to wear those items. 

- I go through entire categories after a season has passed and see what I never got around to wearing. I’ll consider if there was a valid reason (formal dress with no formal events that season will get a pass; one sundress unworn when I wore other sundresses repeatedly, no pass) and donate items I clearly made no effort to wear. 

- When shopping, I open the app and see what all I can match up with an item I’m considering buying. Helps me avoid purchases I’ll never wear. 

- I look through my most worn items for themes. I tend to get the most use out of purses, jackets, and boots in bright colors. This guides me when I’m considering spending a little more on something that fits one of those categories.

- I look through my cost per wear list and assess where my mistakes are happening. Some items are worth extra money and some rarely are. This often coincides with most/least worn items but not always. A super cheap item is still a bit useless if I only use it once, and an expensive item that I won’t use often is also better to avoid. 

- There’s a notes section on each item & I use it to type in words like “thrifted” or “new” so I can search those terms and see if I’m maintaining my preference for a mostly thrifted wardrobe. I also type in the purchase date of an item so I have some frame of reference if an item is on my rarely worn list. Seeing you’ve owned something for 5 years and worn it once hits different than misremembering you bought it 2 years ago. | I’ve been wondering this myself as well! I use Stylebook and I mostly use it for knowing what items I wear most, when the last time I wore something was, but honestly the packing feature is my absolute favorite.

It’s also very enlightening to see what gets worn the least, and I now know to cull these items for my ongoing purge. It’s hard to argue with worn history facts!

What I do not inventory & track:
- Earrings
- Activewear (including workout-only shoes)
- Pajamas / at home only loungewear
- Socks, bras, underwear, hosiery
- Gloves, hats and other seasonal accessories I rarely wear
- Swimwear

I go back and forth on whether it’d be helpful to start inventorying/tracking activewear, though. I have so much, and work out often enough that I’d get something out of it, but I don’t want to burden my daily life by having to log everything. Definitely curious to hear what others are doing! | I've been using cataloguing my wardrobe as motivation to also do the wardrobe purge/reorganization I've been meaning to do for like a year. I just completely emptied out my entire dresser and I've logged almost all of it, even the stuff that I hardly ever wear. For the things that I was already kind of on the fence about, if I couldn't even bring myself to take a picture of them, that was a pretty clear final sign that I could let it go. My drawers are already SO MUCH ROOMIER y'all. 

But I only started about a month ago; have a feeling that, after a year or so, I'll have a much easier time letting go of those edge cases that I kept but already kinda know I shouldn't have. And I'm also hoping it will help me discover new possibilities for older pieces that I haven't been wearing but still feel like I need—who knows? Maybe they'll be my new-old staples.

It also helps that I'm really good at remembering facts about my clothing. I remember where and when I bought things and approximately how much I paid back through about 2018 or so—couldn't tell you why, but it's useful. Maybe because that's when I started selling seriously on Poshmark, which completely upended my relationship with shopping? That Poshmark experience also helps in that I'm really comfy with photographing/editing clothing AND/OR quickly finding stock photos for stuff I know that I own. I've definitely used stock photos for things I've bought recently because I knew I could find them through my email receipts or Shop app aaaand that's easier than dragging the thing out and actually taking a decent picture. But taking one picture is so much easier than taking a bunch that are good enough to post something for sale, so it still feels weirdly easy to me.

Aaaaand also now I'm kinda hooked on the analytics, so I've been logging everything, more or less. Workout outfit that I changed into in the middle of the work day? YES. Lazy WFH athleisure outfit that I intended to go to yoga in later and then flaked on? (Cough today cough) Still logged it, because I like these pieces and I want them to get credit. Is that weird? Yes. ***But the analytics.***

ETA: part of what's keeping me motivated is that I'm using Indyx and I intend to use their stylist feature once I have everything logged. I think having fresh eyes on my wardrobe will be really interesting and will help with that whole goal of re-integrating pieces that have potential but I haven't figured out how to wear.",

Does anyone agree / have any stories to share? | I thrifted a dress from a brand I've never heard of, so I googled them.

Poshmark too - a tip I have is to bypass their search feature entirely and use the google shopping page to search for what you want and just include “Poshmark” - this allows you to describe an item broadly (like you can search for women’s textured black knit vest or something) and get much better results than posh would give you | You can find great stuff at thrift stores, but you have to like thrifting. I just put on headphones and enjoy sifting through the racks, some days I could do it for hours, but I know it's not for everyone. My advice is to visit your local thrift store frequently, check the new arrivals and clearance section first, and be OK with leaving empty-handed. I shop by feel, ignore 99% of the polyester and check tags for fibre content. 

If you hate thrifting just go to Depop/FB Marketplace/Poshmark; that said, you need to know what brands to search for, and I discovered most of my favourite brands by thrifting first, so I think some experience with thrifting is helpful before shopping for secondhand clothes online. | As a millennial it somewhat warms my heart to see so many saying eBay.",

I’ll use Asket as an example since they list the actual prices for raw materials, manufacturing, and markup. This is a merino wool turtleneck that’s $115, which is pretty typical for brands in this tier.

I realize a cheaper and sustainable alternative is to just buy secondhand, but in this case I’m talking about buying new, which is what people commonly do.

What if your style doesn't match your lifestyle?,"I'm 32, and my bf recently commented on my ""cute old lady"" style. He meant it jokingly but it really hurt. I've always been super self conscious about how I dress due to how I grew up. I'm also home alone all day and when I'm out I'm active (hiking/fishing/boating) so my wardrobe is all cheap leggings, sweatshirts and flannels. I don't see a point to owning nice clothes when nobody sees them or they'll get ruined. But after his comment I'm really feeling badly about how I dress.

I've noticed I gravitate strongly to black and white outfits, clean cuts, skirts/dresses, heels. But every time I try on an outfit like that I feel so stupid. Plus it's not practical for my lifestyle. Does anyone else feel like their style isn't suited for their personality/lifestyle and how do you find a balance between what you like and what you can wear?

ETA: Thank you everyone for the encouragement and suggestions! Through the comments I've learned about styles/brands I didn't know existed!

I feel more like me than I have in years. Some of the outfits I’ve put together are out of my comfort zone-a blazer with a bright shirt, jeans, flats and a statement necklace.

Kind of a place where the two meet. | I've grappled with this for a fair bit. When I was younger, I lived in the city, worked in a museum, and generally had a really unique style. I took a lot of risks, bought really interesting pieces, and was proud to be known as a fashionable, stylish person. I also had more of a ""going out"" lifestyle where I was able to really push the envelope with my outfits. Fast forward to now and my work is either done at home or in the field in rural or otherwise less developed areas. I don't do as much going out (due to my travel schedule and my friend network being much more scattered these days) and so my wardrobe has really shifted to more athletic, travel-type clothes that can pack down into a tiny bag and be washed in a sink.

In my heart though, I'm still that girl who loves putting together unique outfits and I really miss her. It took a slightly tipsy post happy hour mild meltdown in a Zara where I told my friend that I was so sad because ""I miss dressing pretty and all I wear are UGLY ADVENTURE CLOTHES"" to help me re-orient things and try to incorporate my need to be styled into my lifestyle of trekking around in the jungle. I leaned into neutral color palettes with unique pieces of jewelry, hats, or scarves to give my look some character. I mix in natural fibers like cotton, linen, and wool with my quick dry athletic wear, which is both super functional and helps me feel put together. When I'm at home, I make it a point to look stylish and put together just about any time I'm leaving the house - I wear all those niece outfits even just to grab a beer with friends.

How do I store my ""wardrobe"" of eyeglasses?

Between relatively recent ""disruptions"" in optical market making cute glasses more affordable and a personal struggle to keep up with my things, I now have a wardrobe(?) of 12-15 pairs of progressive readers in regular rotation. I am usually missing 3-4 pairs at any given time (gym bag? coat pocket? car console? hastily switched purse? Gone Forever?).

Full disclosure: This is a First World Problem, yes. To my mind, I am less likely to buy additional pairs at whatever price if I can keep up with (not lose) what I have. Best ways for me to keep up with what I have are to (i) quit taking my glasses on/off during the day and (ii) develop muscle memory around a storage routine that reminds me which glasses are (probably) where. *I am too vain to do the neck chain dangle thing like my mom ... sorrynotsorry.* Thanks for any help with *storage* tips LOL. | Thoughts on whether a velvet dress would be strictly a holiday dress or something I could wear other times of year.

How to know what alterations to request at tailor,"I have a suit coat that I know I need to take to the tailor to shorten the sleeves and I *think* other alterations.

What do you do with clothes you can't wear right now?,"I had a baby back in October, and as expected, my body is quite different to the way it was this time last year or this summer.

I'm interested in hearing different approaches to this, especially as I live in a flat in London so have limited space.

Wearing Every Piece 100 Times,"I've been thinking about my clothes and impact on the environment, and we can't keep consuming the way we have been the last 20 years, but I don't think that means we have to abandon fashion altogether. I'm sure most people on here have seen the statistic that the average piece of clothing in the US and Canada only gets worn about 7 times before being discarded. On the other extreme (but much rarer) you have people who only buy thrifted clothes once every ten years and don't care about fashion. 

I quit fast fashion, including Zara and H&M, about three years ago, and I was thinking about what more realistic action might look like for a person with an urban job that requires them to be put together, besides give up new clothes entirely. What can a person do who still wants to buy new clothes but wants to do so more responsibly. The thing I came up with was the commitment to wear everything I buy at least 100 times. I know some people have done a ""30 wears"" challenge, but that just doesn't seem like enough to me. What about when you buy something, you have to have an idea that it will be possible to wear it at least 100 times before it goes out of style, wears out, you get sick of it, etc. In most instances this will mean it has to be in your wardrobe for at least a few years and get pretty regular wear.

I'm certainly not the first person to come up with this, but I was thinking about how it would change one's dressing and shopping habits. This Swedish data guy [tracked all his clothing purchases and wears](https://www.reaktor.com/articles/why-ive-tracked-every-single-piece-of-clothing-ive-worn-for-three-years?utm_source=pocket_saves)  and realized that he vastly overestimated how much he was actually wearing most of his clothes. We so often think that we need more than we do. I got a new sweater recently, and after it was a success after a few wears, I immediately started thinking along the lines of  ""hey I should really get at least one more of these,"" because if one is good, two or three is better, right? But then I started thinking about the 100 wears idea, and realized it would be a lot harder to wear that sweater 100 times if there were one or two more of them, even in different colors. I'm not saying it's always a bad idea to have multiples of something, but questioning the assumption seemed important. If I wear it twice a week for half the year, that's still just about 50 wears.  I might realistically wear it 25 times the second year, and maybe even less frequently the third year. 

It's something I've decided to start tracking, and to consider when I make my purchases. Since I quite fast fashion, I buy fewer, better clothes, and I've never been happier with my wardrobe. But I realized recently that I also need to get rid of that fast fashion mindset that more is always better. 

Anyone else interested in the 100 wears idea?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1hava5s/wearing_every_piece_100_times/,hot,"I have been tracking everything I wear for five and a half years, since July 2019, and you are SO right that we tend to overestimate how much we wear stuff! When I started, I guessed how many times I had worn stuff before I started tracking but after tracking for a while, I cut all those guesses WAY down in my spreadsheet. Even my favourite blouse, which I had thought of myself as wearing on repeat, I wore only 4 or 5 times in the first six months. But now most of my clothes have been bought since then and have completely accurate tracking. On my tracker, I have columns that go green at 30 wears, 50 wears and 100 wears. I also track cost per wear - I absolutely LOVE it when it's less than £1 per wear!


Since I started tracking, I have been cutting my wardrobe down by honestly more than 90% - I had about 2000 things when I started. I'm aiming for 88 items in my capsule wardrobe, including everything except pyjamas, underwear and jewellery (I have very few pieces). I'm very close! Also nothing helped me discover my personal style than tracking my wears. It shows you so clearly what you love to wear, in black and white data. 


100 wears is a really good goal but it just won't be possible for lots of stuff - it will just fall apart by then, it's sad to say. But wearing it until it's worn out is an achievement in itself! I consider it worthwhile after 30 wears and/or £1 (or $1 or €1) per wear. It can take a LONG time to hit either of those goals, even with relatively cheap things, and it's really helping me change my shopping habits.


After a few years of really cutting back on clothes shopping, I bought too much this year, and I'm trying to be brave enough to do a complete clothes no buy next year. My other wardrobe goal for 2025 is to wear EVERYTHING I own at least 10 times. It's a tough but achievable goal for almost everything, with the exception of a couple of specialised items. I will reassess everything I own that doesn't get worn that much at the end of the year. It's a quantifiable commitment to loving and using what I own! | While I haven’t intentionally thought I need to wear my items 100 times each, I do track my wardrobe through Stylebook and see I’ve long surpassed that with many items. [My most worn items](https://imgur.com/a/7HdWDDM) shows a lot of purses, rain boots (often needed at work), a pair of jeans, and a few clothing items worth discussing. 

The purple dress worn 64 times is from a fast fashion shop people love to shit on for selling clothes that “fall apart after a few wears,” and it’s still in excellent condition. The black dress worn 61 days is from a Target brand, but I purchased it at Goodwill, meaning its true number of wears is likely higher. It’s also still in excellent condition. My fit & flare puffer coat worn 45 days still looks new; it was a splurge (for me, a poor person) from Venus after I waited for a sale and coupon code to align. 

Like anyone, I do have items in my closet I’ve worn only once (my least worn tab in Stylebook shames me), but I try and learn a lesson from each of those purchases. Am I buying impractical items? Fancy open-toe shoes, for instance, do they really fit into my life when I need closed shoes for work and only get to wear open-toe heels for nights out during the few months of warm weather where I live? Do I really need multiple colors of this type of shoe, when just a pair in silver would cover the majority of my going out summer looks? Admittedly, I own open-toe heels in many colors, a lot of them purchased when I worked a different job, but these questions can stop me from continuing to acquire more.

If I need a formal dress I don’t expect to wear more than a few times, I get it from a thrift shop, take care of it, and donate it back when I’m done with it. Short sequined or metallic dresses actually get a decent amount of use in my closet, so I’m more flexible with buying those. I’ve acquired a few recently that I still haven’t worn, so I’ve stopped buying more and am looking for opportunities to wear the ones I already own in pink, red, green, gold, and rainbow. Not even a party in the club every night kind of gal needs more colors than that. (Totally revealing my age with the thought that women still wear sequined dresses to a club, ha.) I wear them to parties, festive theatre events, and sometimes even casually with the right styling. 

My goal is to get my cost per wear down to $1 or less on everything. Some items are easy due to their low starting cost, but it helps justify the larger purchases when it’s something I really need, like orthotic sandals or a winter coat. My current [lowest cost per wear list](https://imgur.com/a/oThKNEh) shows decent overlap with my most worn items but also reveals some items that just started off unbelievably cheap to begin with, like a silk turtleneck sweater I found at the Goodwill outlet where you pay by the pound. 

All this said, no matter my goals of wearing items many times and driving down their cost per wear, if I discover I really don’t like something after I bought it and do not see myself forcing its use (usually an ill-fitting or horribly uncomfortable item), I donate right away. I’m big on not keeping a lot of clutter around and want someone else to be able to enjoy the item while it’s still practically new and in fashion. | Love this idea! I’ve been sort of trying to do this to justify my more expensive purchases as I ween off of fast fashion by utilizing a rough “Cost Per Wear”. I had a hard time justifying these expensive jeans but they’re such good quality and look amazing and I’ve worn them probably over one hundred times, thus bringing the cost per wear down to 1$ roughly. Meanwhile there are bodysuits in my closet that Im ashamed to admit I’ve never worn that have a 20$ CPW.",

Do you have wardrobe/clothing maintenance “rituals” that you enjoy? ,"I’ve gotten in the habit of handwashing my cashmere sweaters and depilling them with a comb. Just turn on a cozy mystery series and kinda go into a trance combing each sweater….feels oddly therapeutic/relaxing. Of course, it also keeps my knitwear in great shape and makes me appreciate what I have more. 

In the past, a lot of my interaction with my wardrobe is centered around acquiring/shopping. But this is a way to engage and appreciate the pieces I’ve curated without buying more. 

Which made me wonder: do you have any regular wardrobe rituals that you enjoy? ",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1h9vojm/do_you_have_wardrobeclothing_maintenance_rituals/,hot,"Polishing my leather shoes! I love seeing how a little polish brings the leather back to life. I actually did them all on Black Friday to focus on appreciating what I have rather than consuming more. | I've somehow unintentionally ritualized my wardrobe maintenance. There is one day (sometimes 2) I'll dedicate to leather cleaning and conditioning during the year. At the end of the season when its time to put away boots etc, I clean, recondition all of my leather (other leather shoes, leather jackets, leather clothing, handbags and belts). Its somewhat mindless so I put on podcast and by the time I get done with cleaning, items are dry enough for conditioning. Anything that requires work (like a visit to the cobbler) is put aside. I sometimes do a ""lite"" version of this with shoes and handbags in between seasons or when an items needs a bit of tlc. 


I own a lot of silk, cashmere and other items that require hand washing. I always wash those in a batch (I put them aside and wait to have a couple more items to wash).  I fill up the sink and soak similar colored items together (surprisingly not everything is colorfast so I don't take the chances). 




Most all of my clothing gets steamed before I put it back in my closet and this usually ends up being a Sunday chore (with clothing from that week). As I'm steaming I inspect the item to see if it requires stain removal/cleaning, de-fuzzing, new button, etc. I have a ""maintenance"" kit with all the shoe and clothing supplies handy in my closet so it's easy to de-lint coat etc before putting it away. Not unusual to find me in front of the TV de-linting, defuzzing a few items.  




Batching makes some of the maintenance much easier to manage. It feels very satisfying to tend to the things that bring me joy or serve a functional purpose....but I'm also the type of person who enjoys cleaning in general. There is a level of pride I have in having many things in my closet that are decades old and maintained well. | I actually really enjoy hand washing and laying out my knits to dry.

Pantone color of the year 2025: Mocha Mousse,"

If you don't wear it already, do you see this color making it into your wardrobe? What are your thoughts on this color?

What really ARE “nice jeans”? ,"When dressing for certain events, and people say to wear “nice jeans”, what are nice jeans in that instance? Is it about the wash, the fit?

As for the cut...it kind of depends. For work or a conservative environment, I'd avoid any extreme. Where I am, I think you could get away with straight or slim straight, boot cut or slight flare, and wide leg. I would avoid skinny, slouchy, and more extreme flare. Just my opinion, these aren't official rules. The jeans should hang to a good length, not bunch or drag. There may be regional expectations as well. Like, I imagine a place where western wear is a formal option has different denim rules than, say, Boston.

Wtf is happening with Ted Baker?,"Back in August it was reported that is remaining physical stores in the UK and Ireland would close, just months after the same report came in about the North America stores. Ted Baker filed for bankruptcy. They had been acquired and the infusion of money hadn't been enough to keep them afloat.

--------

It seemed like the writing was on the wall that Ted Baker is one brand that can't get away with charging outlandish prices for cheap polyester pieces. Their whole MO appeared to be upscale business casual, a market which took a huge hit through COVID and probably will never recover to its previous dominance. I know a lot of people aren't a fan of Banana Republic's rebranding, but they at least infused a lot more natural materials to try and justify the prices. Today you can look on the Ted Baker website and of the 11 dresses they have, 8 are comprised of 90-100% polyester. These dresses are largely $300-500. What exactly is their game plan? They had a Cyber Monday sale that was just 25% off everything, which is the kind of thing that would make me even less likely to buy something from them full price. The coats were always their bread and butter but I've noticed a difference in the material between old TB coats and one purchased last year - they're certainly not worth what they charge anymore.

----------

I'm just so curious what other people think. Are they even trying to survive? Or are they simply leeching out whatever they can get from people who are loyal to the brand with every intent of letting the whole thing die when numbers get too bleak?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1h5pgx2/wtf_is_happening_with_ted_baker/,hot,"I own 3 Ted dresses from the mid 2010s and they have been some of my most beloved items. All got them at Nordy Rack for $150ish and they're still holding up fab. Gorgeous patterns/botanicals and thick, supple textiles. They were THE house for a sick fit-flare dress that could go office to cocktail hour. 

But I looked at their website just now and... wow, no wonder they totally fell off my radar. Not only did they not really evolve their style with the times, they didn't even continue to offer the unique elements that were at the core of their brand DNA. Much of the ""new in"" section looks clearance-rack bound. Just looks like uninspired, perma-millennial ""they're making me go into the office today"" wear. And this is totally disregarding materials and pricing. 

For others looking to fill the Ted void: I've shifted to new Banana and really been pleased! And for the unique work-to-play pieces I've also become a huge Acler stan. | It looks like the leftovers from when they closed their website a few months back after ongoing clearance sales.  

It's not really clear if the brand has been saved, perhaps it will pick up with the spring/summer range unless this is a last attempt to rid themselves of the winter stock they had at hand at the time before they disappear again.

I loved their coats, but their sizing quality control over the past couple of years was really bad, which made it impossible to buy online from overseas, the shipping costs both ways were not worth it.  In Australia, we only ever had a small part of the range available locally.

I remember buying one coat online in my usual size and it was huge, exchanged for a size down that was a bit snug, then re-purchased the original size locally at an end of season clearance sale and it was perfect! | It's a shame because I looooooved some of their prints!

We are never going to see that good-quality yet affordable middle tier again,"I guess this is more of a thought piece than asking for advice, but I'd love to hear your takes on the questions at the end. 

In the last few years I've seen posts across several brand subreddits complaining about higher prices and lower quality. Lately it was one about Aritzia that inspired this post. And it's objectively true. But I think it's not just a matter of brands being greedy, there are real external forces - ecological, political, and economical - that means we are never getting a $20 white cotton t-shirt that will last 10 years anymore. 

What's happening at Aritzia is happening at pretty much all mid- and low- end fashion brands. Costs have gone way up, from cotton prices (yay climate change!) to higher rents, higher labour and shipping costs, and soon more tariffs, so if they wanted to maintain the same quality they would need to raise prices A LOT. But wages haven't kept up, so if they did that, people would buy fewer pieces because they can't afford more. Brands are faced with two choices: A) maintain quality, increase price, and sell fewer pieces; or B) decrease quality. maintain prices, and sell more pieces. Many in the fast fashion world are going route B) because they would lose their customers otherwise, while those in the luxury fashion segment tend to have gone for route A) because their customers can absorb higher price increases. One notable exception is Banana Republic that has gone for route A). 

There is one ""loophole"", kind of, of up-and-coming brands who are in that early high-growth phase of trying to gain customers at all costs before they start worrying too much about profitability. But this is a phase rather than a category, and as soon as they get popular enough they're going to have to make the same tough decisions. 

My question is how are you adjusting to this reality? Are you buying less, or accepting lower quality? I'm trying to buy better and buy less, but honestly ""buying better"" costs a LOT more than I was ready for. Instead of paying $80 for a sweater that is equivalent to the quality of a $50 sweater ten years ago, it's more like $250. I've had to make some tough decisions about not buying the trendy thing I wanted simply because I can't afford to drop that kind of money on something that might be outdated in a couple of years. I feel like my wardrobe has gotten more boring as a result, but maybe that's a good thing - fashion cycles now are too fast for anyone to keep up with, including the environment.",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1h4z8bn/we_are_never_going_to_see_that_goodquality_yet/,hot,"Honestly I'm rooting for the fall of the rapidly changing fashion cycles, whether it be for economic reasons or otherwise.

I know I'm tired of having perfectly usable clothes from 5-10 years ago that look ""dated"" according to hoards of brands and influencers that are pushing polyester trash.

This really struck a nerve for me when I bought a brand new activewear sweater for $50, maybe $30 after some coupons and rebates I had to hunt down. The material felt like what kids' Halloween costumes were made from 10-20 years ago. I refuse to believe this is the standard that the average person will find acceptable. | I think we as a society should also adjust to having less clothing. Nobody really ""needs"" 20 sweaters or 10 pairs of jeans at one time, and never in history have closets been as big as they are now. 

I was reading a book on historical fashion trends, and people in the past, even the well-off, made do with one or two made-to-measure dresses or suits a year. I also think back to the often quoted statistic that people have been buying 60% more clothing since 2000. Currently trying to downsize my wardrobe, and if I were to only own 5 sweaters at one given time, $300 for a nice cashmere piece that would last me years doesn't seem too outlandish. | I’ve just been buying vintage or waiting to purchase until Labor Day/Black Friday/etc sales roll around.

And since they are vintage they are high quality, even compared to a brand new 100% wool sweater (or whatever material).",

I'm still about 20 pounds heavier than pre-pregnancy and my boobs are enormous. I've managed to find good bras which helps but I just feel that the clothes that I used to like on me just don't look good anymore.


Main problem is that since I'm tall (5' 10"") and have big boobs (36H-ish), I have to wear larger tops, but then they look like tents on me because there's no waist definition, unless I buy something really stretchy. I find that even well-supported, my boobs just make my torso look thicker than it is.


I think the real answer is buying larger clothes and then getting them tailored but this seems like an expensive pain in the ass.


Lately I've preferred figure-hugging shirt dresses and sweater dresses to tops and pants. Maybe I should just embrace that option?


Are there shapes, necklines, fabrics, or silhouettes I should look for that will help?


Thanks!",
"What are your favourite fashion items, to always look classy on night outs?","I’m trying to be more minimal and own less clothes, especially for night outfits, so I’m resetting my closet.My question is, which items will always make you look polished and put together in a night out ?Which items, have many uses and can be combined easily?

I have a silky (but not silk) black tank top that gets worn for everything from regular workdays to nights out to more formal daytime events. Honestly, a decent amount of my workwear gets worn for evenings lol - I have a long suede pencil skirt, a handful of wedge booties, wide leg trousers, even some of my blazers get pulled for nights out. 

For more “bars and clubs” nights out, I usually lean on tights, bodysuits, a pair of corduroy flairs, denim jackets. I have a few silky button downs for work that I’ll crop by tucking into my bra or leave open over a bodysuit. 

Basically, I’m slowly working towards overlapping my work clothes and my personal clothes as much as possible! Work trousers with a low cut top, or button downs with a mini skirt and tights.

Have you ever been surprised by people treating you differently based on your aesthetic?,"A bit of background: I've only ever worked in male dominated fields, first in manual labour jobs as a deckhand, fruit picking, and logging, also some ski patrol and volunteer firefighting. I've always got along with my coworkers and felt understood - as in, they treated me with a lot of respect, understood that I'm extremely capable while still not asking me to do something dangerous.

Over a very short period of time (3 years) I moved into tech and am now in a senior sales role (90-10 men to women in my dept, 100% men in leadership). I moved to Silicon Valley, I go to the office, and work at a desk or WFH. I'm having a very different experience with my coworkers in this field I think its because of my aesthetic and the culture around chivalry.

So obviously I knew I would have to overhaul my wardrobe, I used to never think about aesthetics that much and mostly had practical clothes. I wore a lot of mens clothes and being 175 cm tall I shopped at places Marks Work Warehouse in the mens section easily. 

After overhauling my wardrobe with more feminine pieces, a couple blazers, some dress pants for the office, I noticed people treat me completely differently and not in a way that I like. While they are way more polite than I'm used to they also assume I can't do basic things myself like lift boxes, reach top shelves (even when they're shorter than me) and drive. I don't know how to portray that I have arms and can lift things without coming off as defensive or pissed off. I'm thinking about changing my wardrobe to be more masculine but I'm not sure that would work because professional clothes just don't portray ""I can cut down a tree please don't ask if I need you to help me with carrying equipment"".

So more generally - have you ever been surprised by how people treat you based on your aesthetic and how did you deal with that?",,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1h3vy5q/have_you_ever_been_surprised_by_people_treating/,hot,"Woman in tech leadership here. I’ve worked with almost exclusively men my entire career. I used to present more femininely, as an “office costume,” but now - although not quite masculine because I myself am feminine in my movement - my dress is much more androgynous, with intentional masculine details and edge. This is NOT necessary btw to be in leadership in tech, it’s simply more authentically me, and as I became more confident I started dressing it. 

I think men dial up this “chivalry” when they sense something they consider weakness. Can be a range of things, but in your case I wonder if they’re sensing discomfort in your clothes. You sounded like you felt more authentically yourself when dressing in menswear - why add feminine pieces to your wardrobe? Why not lean into your own instincts?
